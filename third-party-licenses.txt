   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @config-plugins/ffmpeg-kit-react-native@6.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# config-plugins/ffmpeg-kit-react-native

Config plugin to auto-configure `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` when the native code is generated (`npx expo prebuild`).

## Versioning

| `expo` | `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` | `@config-plugins/ffmpeg-kit-react-native` |
| ------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 48.0.0 | 5.1.0                     | ^5.0.0                                    |
| 47.0.0 | 5.1.0                     | ^4.0.0                                    |
| 46.0.0 | 4.5.2                     | ^3.0.0                                    |
| 45.0.0 | 4.5.1                     | ^2.0.0                                    |

## Expo installation

> Tested against Expo SDK 49. Most packages worked on iOS. Not all packages have been tested on Android.

> This package cannot be used in the "Expo Go" app because [it requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/).
> First install the package with yarn, npm, or [`npx expo install`](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/#expo-install).

```sh
yarn add ffmpeg-kit-react-native @config-plugins/ffmpeg-kit-react-native
```

After installing this npm package, add the [config plugin](https://docs.expo.io/guides/config-plugins/) to the [`plugins`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/config/app/#plugins) array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["@config-plugins/ffmpeg-kit-react-native"]
  }
}
```

Next, rebuild your app as described in the ["Adding custom native code"](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) guide.

## API

The plugin provides props for extra customization. Every time you change the props or plugins, you'll need to rebuild (and `prebuild`) the native app. If no extra properties are added, defaults will be used.

- `package` (_string_): Package to use. Options are: `min`, `min-gpl`, `https`, `https-gpl`, `audio`, `video`, `full`, `full-gpl`. [Learn more](https://github.com/tanersener/ffmpeg-kit/tree/main/react-native#211-package-names).
- `ios.package` (_string_): Specify an iOS-only package.
- `android.package` (_string_): Specify an Android-only package.

#### Example

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@config-plugins/ffmpeg-kit-react-native",
        {
          "package": "min",
          "ios": {
            "package": "video"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

- This plugin changes the minimum deployment target on Android to `24` (from `21`) which may break other packages in your app!
- Changing the "package" field on iOS will require re-running `pod install` after updating with `npx expo prebuild -p ios --no-install`.
- Most of the modifications in this plugin are dangerous meaning it's highly likely that something may break over time. The plugin is heavily unit-tested to attempt to prevent breaking.

The `@expo/cli` package is a CLI binary that should be used via `expo` like `npx expo start`.

```
npx expo
```

> ⭐️ Be sure to star the Expo GitHub repo if you enjoy using the project!

## Design

This CLI has the following purposes:

- Be a minimal interface for starting a local development server that emulates a production EAS Updates server. The development server is the proxy between a native runtime (Expo Go, Dev Client) and a JS Bundler (Metro, Webpack).
  - To accomplish secure manifest signing (think https/TSL/SSL for web (required for sandboxing AsyncStorage, Permissions, etc.)) we need an authenticated Expo user account. This is the only reason we include the authentication commands `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `register`. Standard web CLIs don't have authentication commands because they either don't set up https or they use emulation via packages like `devcert`.
- Orchestrating various native tools like Xcode, `Simulator.app`, Android Studio, ADB, etc. to make native builds as painless as possible. `run:ios`, `run:android` commands.
- Implementing a versioned `prebuild` command that can reliably work with a project for long periods of time. Prebuild is like a bundler for native code, it generates the `ios`, `android` folders based on the project Expo config (`app.json`).
  - `npx expo config` is auxiliary to `npx expo prebuild` and used for debugging/introspection.
- Installing versioned libraries with `npx expo install` this is a minimal utility born out of pure necessity since versioning in React Native is hard to get right.

# Contributing

To develop the CLI run (defaults to watch mode):

```
yarn build
```

We highly recommend setting up an alias for the Expo CLI so you can try it in projects all around your computer. Open your `.zshrc` or other config file and add:

```
alias nexpo="/path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli"
```

Then use it with `nexpo` like `nexpo config`. You can also set up a debug version:

```
alias expo-inspect="node --inspect /path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli"
```

Then you can run it and visit `chrome://inspect/#devices` in Chrome, and press "Open dedicated DevTools for Node" to get a debugger attached to your process. When debugging the CLI, you'll want to disable workers whenever possible, this will make all code run on the same thread, this is mostly applicable to the `start` command, i.e. `expo-inspect start --max-workers 0`.

## Format

- Be sure to update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) with changes for every PR. You only need to add the message, our GitHub bot will automatically suggest adding your name and PR number to the diff.
- End `async` functions with `Async` like `runAsync`. This is just how we format functions at Expo.
- When throwing errors, always opt for `CommandError` instead of `Error` -- this helps with debugging and making the experience feel more coherent.
- Utilize the unified `Log` module instead of `console.log`.
- When logging with variables, utilize the following format `Something happened (foo: bar, baz: foz)`.
  - Avoid other formats like `Something happened: bar, foz` or `Something happened: foo=bar, baz=foz`.
- Main UI components like command names (`expo start`), arguments (`--port`), and `--help` messages should be modified internally, by the Expo team to ensure the developer experience is unified across Expo tooling. External contributions modifying these core aspects may be rejected.
- Use the `profile` utility method with the `EXPO_PROFILE=1` environment variable to measure execution time.
- Avoid globals and singletons as these make testing harder and less predictable. The only global we have (at the time of writing this) is the `isOffline` boolean.

## Environment

- Always be cautious of the transitive size of dependencies. [packagephobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh/) is a great resource for determining if a package is lean. Try to minimize adding dependencies to the CLI.
- We build the CLI using `taskr` + `swc`, this is partially inspired by Next.js' local CLI.
- The build pipeline will inline the CLI version as an environment variable that is accessible anywhere in the CLI codebase. You can access it via `process.env.__EXPO_VERSION` instead of reading the local `package.json` at runtime.
- Unlike the legacy global Expo CLI, this CLI is shipped with `expo` meaning the SDK Version is always present.
  - Reduce SDK specific tasks since only one SDK should be accounted for in a single version of `@expo/cli`.
  - The `@expo/config` method `getConfig` does not need the `skipSDKVersionRequirement` in any case since `expo` should always be installed. Ex: `getConfig('...', { skipSDKVersionRequirement: true });` shouldn't be used.
- Also unlike the global Expo CLI we can assume that node modules are always installed since this CLI should be used via a project's local `node_modules` folder.
  - This means we can't perform operations that upgrade the `expo` package as these may kill the running process. Features that need this pattern (like `expo upgrade`) should live in standalone global tools.

## Testing

There are two testing scripts:

- `yarn test`: Controlled unit and integration tests.
- `yarn test:e2e`: End to end testing for CLI commands. This requires the files to be built with `yarn build`

---

- You can target a specific set of tests with the `--watch` flag. Example: `yarn test --watch config`.
- We use backticks for `it` blocks. Example <code>it(`works`)</code>.
- If a pull request is fully self-contained to the `packages/@expo/cli/` folder (i.e. no `yarn.lock` modifications, etc.) then most native CI tests will be skipped, making CI pass faster in PRs.

### Unit Testing Guidelines

- Use `nock` for network requests.
- No top level `describe` blocks that wrap all the tests in a file.
- When testing a function, pass the function to the `describe` block instead of a stringified function name:
  - `describe(foobar, () => {})` instead of `describe('foobar', () => {})`
- Use virtual `fs` via `memfs` whenever possible.
- We have a lot of global module [**mocks**](./e2e/setup.ts) already in place, consider them when writing tests.
- GitHub Copilot can make writing tests a little less tedious.

### E2E Testing Guidelines

- E2E tests should be resilient and reliable, be sure to give them plenty of time for network requests.
- When testing locally you should attempt to reuse node modules for faster results. In the `npx expo prebuild` and `npx expo start` commands for instance, we utilize a helper method that will default to reusing a project + node_modules when run locally. This can be [toggled off](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/11a5a4d27b7e1c8e4d6ddf0401397d789d89f52a/packages/%40expo/cli/e2e/__tests__/utils.ts#L174) to bootstrap a fresh project every time.
- When bootstrapping test projects, utilize the temporary folder `os.tmpdir()` as this folder is automatically cleaned up when the computer restarts.

## Coming from Expo CLI

> TL;DR: `expo-cli` was 'make it work', whereas `@expo/cli` is 'make it right, make it fast'.

The legacy global `expo-cli` package was deprecated in favor of this versioned `@expo/cli` package for the following reasons:

- `expo-cli` was too big and took way too long to install. This made CI frustrating to set up since you needed to also target global node modules for caching.
- `expo-cli` worked for almost all versions of the `expo` package, meaning it was getting more complex with every release.
- `expo-cli` combined service commands (like the legacy `build`, `submit`, `publish`) with project-level commands like `expo start`. We've since divided services into `eas-cli` and project commands into `npx expo` (`@expo/cli`). This structure is more optimal/faster for developers since they can install/update commands when they need them.
- This CLI utilizes more Node.js standard features like `$EDITOR` instead of the custom `$EXPO_EDITOR` environment variable. Also transitioning away from `$EXPO_DEBUG` and more towards `$DEBUG=expo:*`. These types of changes make Expo CLI play nicer with existing tooling.
- The DevTools UI has been deprecated to reduce the net install size, minimize complexity, and make room for future debugging UIs (Hermes/v8 Chrome debugger).
- The `expo start:web` and `expo web` commands have been rolled into `npx expo start` as we now lazily load platforms until the device requests them.
- Other missing or beta features from `expo-cli` may still be getting migrated over to this new CLI. For a more comprehensive breakdown see the [start command PR](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/16160).

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @expo/devcert@1.1.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# expo/devcert

A fork of `devcert` with bundle size optimizations.

# devcert - Development SSL made easy

So, running a local HTTPS server usually sucks. There's a range of
approaches, each with their own tradeoff. The common one, using self-signed
certificates, means having to ignore scary browser warnings for each project.

devcert makes the process easy. Want a private key and certificate file to
use with your server? Just ask:

```js
let ssl = await devcert.certificateFor("my-app.test");
https.createServer(ssl, app).listen(3000);
```

Now open https://my-app.test:3000 and voila - your page loads with no scary
warnings or hoops to jump through.

> Certificates are cached by name, so two calls for
> `certificateFor('foo')` will return the same key and certificate.

## Options

When it installs or upgrades, devcert creates a self-signed certificate
authority (CA) which it uses to sign all certificates it creates. It will try
to register this CA with OS keychains in OSX, Linux, and Windows. However,
some HTTP clients (such as Firefox and NodeJS itself) use their own trusted
certificate list instead of the operating system's keychain. The `getCaPath`
and `getCaBuffer` options make the CA available in the `certificateFor()`
return object itself, so that these programs can choose whether to trust it.

### getCaPath

Set this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `caPath`
property, set to the file path of the certificate authority file. Use this
path to add the certificate to local trust stores which accept paths as
arguments, such as NodeJS's builtin environment variable
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`..

### getCaBuffer

Set this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `ca`
property, set to the UTF-8-encoded contents of the certificate authority
file. Use this path to add the certificate to local trust stores which don't
use OS settings, lke the examples mentioned above.

### skipHostsFile

If you supply a custom domain name (i.e. any domain other than `localhost`)
when requesting a certificate from devcert, it will attempt to modify your
system to redirect requests for that domain to your local machine (rather
than to the real domain). It does this by modifying your `/etc/hosts` file.

If you pass in the `skipHostsFile` option, devcert will skip this step. This
means that if you ask for certificates for `my-app.test` (for example), and
don't have some other DNS redirect method in place, that you won't be able to
access your app at `https://my-app.test` because your computer wouldn't know
that `my-app.test` should resolve your local machine.

Keep in mind that SSL certificates are issued for _domains_, so if you ask
for a certificate for `my-app.test`, and don't have any kind of DNS redirect
in place (`/etc/hosts` or otherwise), trying to hit `localhost` won't work,
even if the app you intended to serve via `my-app.test` is running on your
local machine (since the SSL certificate won't say `localhost`).

### skipCertutil

This option will tell devcert to avoid installing `certutil` tooling.

`certutil` is a tooling package used to automated the installation of SSL
certificates in certain circumstances; specifically, Firefox (for every OS)
and Chrome (on Linux only).

Normally, devcert will attempt to install `certutil` if it's need and not
already present on your system. If don't want devcert to install this
package, pass `skipCertutil: true`.

If you decide to `skipCertutil`, the initial setup process for devcert
changes in these two scenarios:

- **Firefox on all platforms**: Thankully, Firefox makes this easy. There's a
  point-and-click wizard for importing and trusting a certificate, so if you
  specify `skipCertutil: true`, devcert will instead automatically open Firefox
  and kick off this wizard for you. Simply follow the prompts to trust the
  certificate. **Reminder: you'll only need to do this once per machine**

- **Chrome on Linux**: Unfortunately, it appears that the **only** way to get
  Chrome to trust an SSL certificate on Linux is via the `certutil` tooling -
  there is no manual process for it. Thus, if you are using Chrome on Linux, do
  **not** supply `skipCertuil: true`. If you do, devcert certificates will not
  be trusted by Chrome.

The `certutil` tooling is installed in OS-specific ways:

- Mac: `brew install nss`
- Linux: `apt install libnss3-tools`
- Windows: N/A (there is no easy, hands-off way to install certutil on Windows,
  so devcert will simply fallback to the wizard approach for Firefox outlined
  above)

## How it works

When you ask for a development certificate, devcert will first check to see
if it has run on this machine before. If not, it will create a root
certificate authority and add it to your OS and various browser trust stores.
You'll likely see password prompts from your OS at this point to authorize
the new root CA.

Since your machine now trusts this root CA, it will trust any certificates
signed by it. So when you ask for a certificate for a new domain, devcert
will use the root CA credentials to generate a certificate specific to the
domain you requested, and returns the new certificate to you.

If you request a domain that has already had certificates generated for it,
devcert will simply return the cached certificates.

This setup ensures that browsers won't show scary warnings about untrusted
certificates, since your OS and browsers will now trust devcert's
certificates.

## Security Concerns

There's a reason that your OS prompts you for your root password when devcert
attempts to install it's root certificate authority. By adding it to your
machine's trust stores, your browsers will automatically trust _any_ certificate
generated with it.

This exposes a potential attack vector on your local machine: if someone else
could use the devcert certificate authority to generate certificates, and if
they could intercept / manipulate your network traffic, they could theoretically
impersonate some websites, and your browser would not show any warnings (because
it trusts the devcert authority).

To prevent this, devcert takes steps to ensure that no one can access the
devcert certificate authority credentials to generate malicious certificates
without you knowing. The exact approach varies by platform:

- **macOS and Linux**: the certificate authority's credentials are written to files that are only readable by the root user (i.e. `chown 0 ca-cert.crt` and
  `chmod 600 ca-cert.crt`). When devcert itself needs these, it shells out to
  `sudo` invocations to read / write the credentials.
- **Windows**: because of my unfamiliarity with Windows file permissions, I
  wasn't confident I would be able to correctly set permissions to mimic the setup
  on macOS and Linux. So instead, devcert will prompt you for a password, and then
  use that to encrypt the credentials with an AES256 cipher. The password is never
  written to disk.

To further protect these credentials, any time they are written to disk, they
are written to temporary files, and are immediately deleted after they are no longer needed.

Additionally, the root CA certificate is unique to your machine only: it's
generated on-the-fly when it is first installed. ensuring there are no
central / shared keys to crack across machines.

### Why install a root certificate authority at all?

The root certificate authority makes it simpler to manage which domains are
configured for SSL by devcert. The alternative is to generate and trust
self-signed certificates for each domain. The problem is that while devcert
is able to add a certificate to your machine's trust stores, the tooling to
remove a certificate doesn't cover every case. So if you ever wanted to
_untrust_ devcert's certificates, you'd have to manually remove each one from
each trust store.

By trusting only a single root CA, devcert is able to guarantee that when you
want to _disable_ SSL for a domain, it can do so with no manual intervention

- we just delete the domain-specific certificate files. Since these
  domain-specific files aren't installed in your trust stores, once they are
  gone, they are gone.

## Integration

devcert has been designed from day one to work as low-level library that other
tools can delegate to. The goal is to make HTTPS development easy for everyone,
regardless of framework or library choice.

With that in mind, if you'd like to use devcert in your library/framework/CLI,
devcert makes that easy.

In addition to the options above, devcert exposes a `ui` option. This option
allows you to control all the points where devcert requries user interaction,
substituting your own prompts and user interface. You can use this to brand
the experience with your own tool's name, localize the messages, or integrate
devcert into a larger existing workflow.

The `ui` option should be an object with the following methods:

```ts
{
  async getWindowsEncryptionPassword(): Promise<string> {
    // Invoked when devcert needs the password used to encrypt the root
    // certificate authority credentials on Windows. May be invoked multiple
    // times if the user's supplied password is incorrect
  },
  async warnChromeOnLinuxWithoutCertutil(): Promise<string> {
    // Invoked when devcert is run on Linux, detects that Chrome is installed,
    // and the `skipCertutil` option is `true`. Used to warn the user that
    // Chrome will not work with `skipCertutil: true` on Linux.
  },
  async closeFirefoxBeforeContinuing() {
    // Invoked when devcert detects that Firefox is running while it is trying
    // to programmatically install it's certificate authority in the Firefox
    // trust store. Firefox appears to overwrite changes to the trust store on
    // exit, so Firefox must be closed before devcert can continue. devcert will
    // wait for Firefox to exit - this is just to prompt the user that they
    // need to close the application.
  },
  async startFirefoxWizard(certificateHost: string) {
    // Invoked when devcert detects a Firefox installation and `skipCertutil:
    // true` was specified. This is invoked right before devcert launches the
    // Firefox certificate import wizard GUI. Used to give the user a heads up
    // as to why they are about to see Firefox pop up.
    //
    // The certificateHost provided is the URL for the temporary server that
    // devcert has spun up in order to trigger the wizard(Firefox needs try to
    // "download" the cert to trigger the wizard). This URL will load the page
    // supplied in the `firefoxWizardPromptPage()` method below.
    //
    // Normally, devcert will automatically open this URL, but in case it fails
    // you may want to print it out to the console with an explanatory message
    // so the user isn't left hanging wondering what's happening.
  },
  async firefoxWizardPromptPage(certificateURL: string): Promise<string> {
    // When devcert starts the Firefox certificate installation wizard GUI, it
    // first loads an HTML page in Firefox. The template used for that page is
    // the return value of this method. The supplied certificateURL is the path
    // to the actual certificate. The Firefox tab must attempt to load this URL
    // to trigger the wizard.
    //
    // The default implemenation is a simple redirect to that URL. But you could
    // supply your own branded template here, with a button that says "Install
    // certificate" that is linked to the certificateURL, along with a more in
    // depth explanation of what is happening for example.
  }
  async waitForFirefoxWizard() {
    // Invoked _after_ the Firefox certificate import wizard is kicked off. This
    // method should not resolve until the user indicates that the wizard is
    // complete (unfortunately, we have no way of determining that
    // programmatically)
  }
}
```

You can supply any or all of these methods - ones you do not supply will fall
back to the default implemenation.

## Testing

Testing a tool like devcert can be a pain. I haven't found a good automated
solution for cross platform GUI testing (the GUI part is necessary to test
each browser's handling of devcert certificates, as well as test the Firefox
wizard flow).

To make things easier, devcert comes with a series of virtual machine images. Each one is a snapshot taken right before running a test - just launch the machine and hit <Enter>.

You can also use the snapshotted state of the VMs to roll them back to a
pristine state for another round of testing.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

agent-base
==========
### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.

#### Some subclasses:

Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
Send a pull request to list yours!

 * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
 * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
 * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
 * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install agent-base
```


Example
-------

Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):

```js
var net = require('net');
var tls = require('tls');
var url = require('url');
var http = require('http');
var agent = require('agent-base');

var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);

// This is the important part!
parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
  var socket;
  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
    socket = tls.connect(opts);
  } else {
    socket = net.connect(opts);
  }
  return socket;
});

// Everything else works just like normal...
http.get(parsed, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:

```js
agent(async function (req, opts) {
  await sleep(1000);
  // etc…
});
```

Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
for that HTTP request to that agent:

```js
agent(function (req, opts) {
  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
});
```


API
---

## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]

Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.

The `options` object accepts the following properties:

  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).

The callback function should have the following signature:

### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined

The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
continue to proceed.

If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

      - [`ifElse`](#ifElse)
      - [`provide`](#provide)

## Installation

```bash
yarn add ansi-fragments
```

## Usage

```js
import { color, modifier, pad, container } from 'ansi-fragments';

const prettyLog = (level, message) => container(
  color('green', modifier('italic', level)),
  pad(1),
  message
).build();

console.log(prettyLog('success', 'Yay!'));
```

## API

Each fragment implements `IFragment` interface:

```ts
interface IFragment {
  build(): string;
}
```

The `build` method is responsible for traversing the tree of fragments and create a string representation with ANSI escape codes.


#### `color`

```ts
color(
  ansiColor: AnsiColor,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [colors](./src/fragments/Color.ts).

```js
color('red', 'Oh no');
color('bgBlue', color('brightBlue', 'Hey'));
color('green', modifier('bold', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `modifier`

```ts
modifier(
  ansiModifier: AnsiModifier,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [modifiers](./src/fragments/Modifier.ts): `dim`, `bold`, `hidden`, `italic`, `underline`, `strikethrough`.

```js
modifier('underline', 'Hello', 'World');
modifier('italic', modifier('bold', 'Hey'));
modifier('bold', color('green', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `container`

```ts
container(...children: Array<string | IFragment>): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which sole purpose is to hold and build nested fragments.

```js
container(
  color('gray', '[08/01/18 12:00]'),
  pad(1),
  color('green', 'success'),
  pad(1),
  'Some message'
)
```

#### `pad`

```ts
pad(count: number, separator?: string): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which repeats given separator (default: ` `) given number of times.

```js
pad(1);
pad(2, '#')
pad(1, '\n')
```

#### `fixed`

```ts
fixed(
  value: number,
  bias: 'start' | 'end',
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which makes sure the children will always build to given number of non-ANSI characters. It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.

```js
fixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'
fixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '
fixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'
```

#### `ifElse`

```ts
ifElse(
  condition: Condition,
  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,
  elseFragment: string | IFragment
): IFragment

type ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;
type Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);
```

Change the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.

```js
let condition = getConditionValue()
ifElse(
  () => condition,
  color('red', 'ERROR'),
  color('yellow', 'WARNING')
)
```

#### `provide`

```ts
provide<T>(
  value: T,
  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment
): IFragment
```

Provides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.

```js
provide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {
  switch (value.level) {
    case 'error':
      return container(
        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    case 'info':
      return container(
        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    default:
      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);
  }
})
```

A node.js library to get paths to directories to store configs, caches and data according to OS standarts.

## Installation

```sh
npm install appdirsjs
```

or

```sh
yarn install appdirsjs
```

if you're using yarn.

## Usage

```javascript
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({ appName: "expo" });

console.log(dirs.cache);
// /home/user/.cache/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Caches/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\expo on Windows

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.config/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Preferences/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\expo

console.log(dirs.data);
// /home/user/.local/share/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Application Support/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\expo
```

### Keep backward compability

Then switching from old-style dotfile directory,
such as `~/.myapp` to new, like `~/.config/myapp`,
you can pass `legacyPath` parameter
to keep using old directory if it exists:

```javascript
import * as path from "path";
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({
  appName: "expo",
  // Notice usage of full path
  legacyPath: path.join(os.homedir(), ".expo"),
});

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.expo
```

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - babel-core@7.0.0-bridge.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## babel-bridge

This repo holds what we're calling a "bridge" package that is meant to ease the
transition for libraries that use "babel-core" as a peer dependency for Babel 6.

The issue with Babel 7's transition to scopes is that if a package depends on
Babel 6, they may want to add support for Babel 7 alongside. Because Babel 7
will be released as `@babel/core` instead of `babel-core`, maintainers have
no way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.

```js
peerDependencies: {
  "babel-core": "6.x"
}
```
cannot change to

```js
peerDependencies: {
  "@babel/core": "6.x"
}
```

without it being a breaking change.

### Solution

To address this, we're releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do


```js
peerDependencies: {
  "babel-core": "6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge"
}
```

then where users of this package would originally have done

```sh
npm i some-package babel-core
```

to install Babel 6, they could now do


```sh
npm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core
```

to install the bridge package, and install Babel 7's core.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas@7.0.0-beta.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas

> Compile trailing function commas to ES5


```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```

## Example

### Basic
This is an example from the [Proposal](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-trailing-function-commas).

Let's say you have this function:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar'
);
```

If you want to have a new parameter called `param3`, the diff output would be like that:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
- param2
+ param2, // Change this line to add a comma
+ param3  // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
- 'bar'
+ 'bar', // Change this line to add a comma
+ 'baz'  // Add param3
);
```
In total, you have to change 2 lines for the function declaration and 2 lines for each usage.

If you had your function defined with trailing commas:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```
Adding a new parameter would only change one line in the function declaration and one line for each usage:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
+ param3, // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
+ 'baz', // Add param3
);
```
In the end, your diff output will be cleaner and easier to read, it would be much quicker to add a new parameter to your functions, it also makes it easier to copy paste elements and move code around.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - babel-preset-expo@9.5.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-preset-expo

This preset extends the default React Native preset (`metro-react-native-babel-preset`) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed.

You can use this preset in any React Native project as a drop-in replacement for `metro-react-native-babel-preset`. If your project isn't using native font loading or web support then this preset will only add support for decorators with `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` - this is mostly used for supporting legacy community libraries.

If you start your **web** project with `@expo/webpack-config` or `npx expo start` and your project doesn't contain a `babel.config.js` or a `.babelrc` then it will default to using `babel-preset-expo` for loading.

If you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports
at https://github.com/expo/expo. Thanks!

## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance

A bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.

### Babel Loader

The babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its `caller`.

#### platform

A `platform` property denoting the target platform. If the `platform` is not defined, it will default to using `web` when the `bundler` is `webpack` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.

| Value     | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `ios`     | Runs on iOS devices     |
| `android` | Runs on Android devices |
| `web`     | Runs in web browsers    |

#### bundler

A `bundler` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle.
If the `bundler` is not defined, it will default to checking if a `babel-loader` is used, if so then `webpack` will be used, otherwise it will default to `metro`.

| Value     | Description                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `metro`   | Bundling with [Metro][metro]     |
| `webpack` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |

[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/
[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/

## Options

### [`jsxRuntime`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#runtime)

`classic | automatic`, defaults to `automatic`

- `automatic` automatically convert JSX to JS without the need to `import React from 'react'` in every file. Be sure to follow the rest of the [setup guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform) after enabling this, otherwise ESLint and other tools will throw warnings.
- `classic` does not automatically import anything, React must imported into every file that uses JSX syntax.

```js
[
  'babel-preset-expo',
  {
    jsxRuntime: 'classic',
  },
];
```

This property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This flag does nothing when `native.useTransformReactJSXExperimental` is set to `true` because `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` is omitted.

### [`jsxImportSource`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#importsource)

`string`, defaults to `react`

This option allows specifying a custom import source for importing functions.

```js
[
  'babel-preset-expo',
  {
    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
    jsxImportSource: 'react',
  },
];
```

This property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This options does nothing when `jsxRuntime` is not set to `automatic`.

### [`lazyImports`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)

Changes Babel's compiled `import` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.

_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the `disableImportExportTransform` option is set to `false`. On Android and iOS, `disableImportExportTransform` defaults to `false`, and on web it defaults to `true` to allow for tree shaking.

This can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.

The value of `lazyImports` has a few possible effects:

- `null` - [metro-react-native-babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/metro/tree/master/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d)

- `false` - No lazy initialization of any imported module.

- `true` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., `./foo`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy).

- `Array<string>` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.

- `(string) => boolean` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.

  If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using `const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');` which returns a `Set`.

**default:** `null`

```js
[
    'babel-preset-expo',
    {
        lazyImports: true
    }
],
```

### `web.disableImportExportTransform`

Enabling this option will allow your project to run with older JavaScript syntax (i.e. `module.exports`). This option will break tree shaking and increase your bundle size, but will eliminate the following error when `module.exports` is used:

> `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'`

**default:** `false` when using Webpack. `true` otherwise.

```js
[
    'babel-preset-expo',
    {
        web: { disableImportExportTransform: true }
    }
],
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - badgin@1.2.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Badgin

The [Badging API](https://web.dev/badging-api/) is a new web platform API that allows installed web apps to set an application-wide badge, shown in an operating-system-specific place associated with the application (such as the shelf or home screen). The Badging API works on Windows, and macOS, in Chrome 81 or later. It has also been confirmed to work on Edge 84 or later. Support for Chrome OS is in development and will be available in a future release of Chrome. On Android, the Badging API is not supported. Instead, Android automatically shows a badge on app icon for the installed web app when there is an unread notification, just as for Android apps. Since this API is not available everywhere, `badgin` safely falls back to alternatives.

## via badge

Currently, the native badge is only displayed if you install the web application to your home screen (view [prerequisites](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners)). The screenshot shows the application in the dock of macOS.

![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/standalone_osx.png)

## via favicon

If the native badge is not available, the favicon will be used and a small badge will be added.

![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/favicon.png)

## via title

If the favicon is not available, the badge will be added as a prefix to the title.

![](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin/raw/master/assets/screenshots/title.png)

## Demo

You can find a demo at https://jaulz.github.io/badgin/ where you can see the different options. If you want to see the native badge, you need to install the app to your home screen (check out the plus icon in the address bar).

## Installation

The module can be installed by running:

```
yarn add --save badgin
```

## Usage

Just use the library as following:

```js
import badgin from 'badgin'

badgin.set(1) // set value
badgin.set() // set indicator only
badgin.clear()
```

### Options

The following options can be used:

```js
{
  method: 'Badging' | 'Favicon' | 'Title'
  favicon: {
    backgroundColor: string = '#424242'
    color: string = '#ffffff'
    indicator: string = '!'
    radius: number = 3
    size: number = 7
    horizontalMargin: number = 0
    verticalMargin: number = 0
    horizontalPadding: number = 1
    verticalPadding: number = 1
  }
  title: {
    indicator: string = '!'
  }
}
```

And you can use it like this:

```js
badgin.set(1, {
  favicon: {
    width: 9,
    background: '#549A2F',
  },
})
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - bser@2.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# BSER Binary Serialization

BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
encoded values.

It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
system filename storage.

For more details about the serialization scheme see
[Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).

## API

```js
var bser = require('bser');
```

### bser.loadFromBuffer

The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,
decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the
input is invalid.

```js
var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);
```

### bser.dumpToBuffer

Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.

```js
var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);
console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']
```

### BunserBuf

The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.
You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the
decoded values via its `value` event.

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log(obj);
});
```

Then in your socket `data` event:

```js
bunser.append(buf);
```

## Example

Read BSER from socket:

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log('data from socket', obj);
});

var socket = net.connect('/socket');

socket.on('data', function(buf) {
  bunser.append(buf);
});
```

Write BSER to socket:

```js
socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));
```

```

## Usage

```js
const allocUnsafe = require('buffer-alloc-unsafe')

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 78 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 05 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 58 ed bf 5f ff 7f 00 00 01 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 50 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 0a 00>

allocUnsafe(-10)
//=> RangeError: "size" argument must not be negative
```

## API

### allocUnsafe(size)

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes. The `size` must be
less than or equal to the value of `buffer.kMaxLength` and greater than or equal
to zero. Otherwise, a `RangeError` is thrown.

## API

### alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`
- `fill` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; A value to pre-fill the new `Buffer` with. **Default:** `0`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `fill` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`

Allocates a new `Buffer` of `size` bytes. If `fill` is `undefined`, the `Buffer` will be zero-filled.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - buffer-fill@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Buffer Fill

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.

Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```

## Usage

```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5)

console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>

console.log(buf.fill(9, 2, 4))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 09 09 08>

console.log(buf.fill('linus', 'latin1'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73>

console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```

## API

### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])

- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`

Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.

If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - denodeify@1.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

denodeify [ ![Codeship Status for matthew-andrews/denodeify](https://codeship.io/projects/02ac77d0-1a58-0132-bf86-4a07366ee29d/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/34622)
=========

Tool to turn functions with Node-style callback APIs into functions that return [Promises](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

Inspired by and adapted from Q's [`Q.denodeify`/`Q.nfcall` function](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#qnfbindnodefunc-args).

Warning: This micro-library doesn't force you to use any particular Promise implementation by using whatever `Promise` has been defined as globally.  This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.

If you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-
- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`
- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`
- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`
- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`

Note: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. 

## Installation

```
npm install denodeify --save
```

Or:-

```
bower install denodeify --save
```

## Examples

Simple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);

readFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })
  .then(function(text) {
    console.log("My file's contents is: " + text);
  });
```

(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)

More complex example with `exec`:-

## Advanced usage

You can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {

  // Throw away stderr data
  return [err, stdout];
});

exec('hostname')
  .then(function(host) {
    console.log("My hostname is: " + host.replace('\n', ''));
  });
```

Or,

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {
  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];
});

exec('my-command')
  .then(function(results) {
    console.log("stdout is: " + results[0]);
    console.log("stderr is: " + results[1]);
  });
```

Useful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

## Credits and collaboration ##

The lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

- Add the following configuration to your app's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "expo-yarn-workspaces": {
    "symlinks": ["expo-constants"]
  }
}
```

- Finally, run `yarn` in the app folder to create symlinks to `expo-constants` in your app's local `node_modules` folder.

`expo-dev-client` is an npm package installable in any Expo or React Native project. Once installed, Debug builds of your application will gain an extensible debug menu and the ability to load projects from Expo CLI. Release builds of your application will not change other than the addition of a few header files. Your debug builds can be shared with anyone on your team who needs to work on or review your application. Your team can develop the JavaScript portion of your application with expo-cli and your custom client without waiting for your native code to build until the
next time you need to upgrade, install a new module, or otherwise change the native code in your project.

## Documentation

You can find more information in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/home/develop/development-builds/introduction).

## Issues

If you encounter any issues using this package in your project, please [report your issue here](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/new?template=dev_client_bug_report.yml).

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - expo-dev-launcher@2.4.14

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# expo-dev-launcher

`expo-dev-launcher` is an npm package installable in any Expo or React Native project. Once installed, any Debug builds of your application will gain the ability to load projects from Expo CLI. Release builds of your application will not change other than the addition of a few header files. This package is intended to be included in your project through [`expo-dev-client`](https://docs.expo.dev/clients/introduction/).

## Documentation

You can find more information in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/home/develop/development-builds/introduction).

## Contributing

The `expo-dev-launcher` repository consists of two different parts, the exported package, which includes the native functions, located in the `android`, `ios` and `src` folders and the Dev Launcher interface, located under the `bundle` folder.

Local development is usually done through `bare-expo`.

To use `dev-client` when running `bare-expo` on Android, open [MainApplication.java](/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/java/dev/expo/payments/MainApplication.java) and set the `USE_DEV_CLIENT` value to `true`.

```diff
- static final boolean USE_DEV_CLIENT = false;
+ static final boolean USE_DEV_CLIENT = true;
```

To use `dev-client` when running `bare-expo` on iOS, open [AppDelegate.mm](/apps/bare-expo/ios/BareExpo/AppDelegate.mm) and set the `USE_DEV_CLIENT` value to `YES`.

```diff
- BOOL useDevClient = NO;
+ BOOL useDevClient = YES;
```

### Making JavaScript changes inside the `bundle` folder

To update the JavaScript code inside the `bundle` folder, you need to run the `dev-launcher` bundler locally.

1. Navigate to the `dev-launcher` package: `cd packages/expo-dev-launcher`
2. Start the Metro bundler: `yarn start`
3. Adjust the dev-launcher URL to point to your local bundler

<details>

#### On Android

Open [DevLauncherController.kt](/packages/expo-dev-launcher/android/src/debug/java/expo/modules/devlauncher/DevLauncherController.kt) and update the `DEV_LAUNCHER_HOST` value to your bundler URL.

E.g.

```diff
- private val DEV_LAUNCHER_HOST: String? = null
+ private val DEV_LAUNCHER_HOST: String? = "10.0.2.2:8090";
```

#### On iOS

3.1. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `ios` folder inside `bare-expo`

3.2. Export the `EX_DEV_LAUNCHER_URL` variable in your shell before running `pod install`.

E.g.

```
export EX_DEV_LAUNCHER_URL=http://localhost:8090
```

This will cause the controller to see if the `expo-launcher` packager is running, and if so, use that instead of the prebuilt bundle.

3.3. Run `pod install`

</details>

4. Recompile `bare-expo`
5. Play with your changes on a simulator or device
6. Once you've made all the necessary changes run `yarn bundle` to update the embedded bundle

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
npm install expo-dev-menu-interface
```

# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Please refer to guidelines described in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/expo/expo#contributing).

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - expo-dev-menu@3.2.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# 📦 expo-dev-menu

Expo/React Native module to add developer menu to Debug builds of your application. This package is intended to be included in your project through [`expo-dev-client`](https://docs.expo.dev/home/develop/development-builds/introduction/#what-is-an-expo-dev-client).

## Documentation

You can find more information in the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/home/develop/development-builds/introduction).

## Contributing

The `expo-dev-menu` repository consists of two different parts, the exported package, which includes the native functions, located in the `android`, `ios` and `src` folders and the Dev Menu interface, located under the `app` folder.

Local development is usually done through [`bare-expo`](/apps/bare-expo).

First, make sure to `yarn` and `yarn start` in `expo-dev-menu` which will add the port for the dev menu packager to [`dev-menu-packager-host`](./assets/dev-menu-packager-host`). This is bundled into the native code in `bare-expo` so need to be done first.

To use `dev-client` when running `bare-expo` on Android, open [MainApplication.java](/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/java/dev/expo/payments/MainApplication.java) and set the `USE_DEV_CLIENT` value to `true`.

```diff
- static final boolean USE_DEV_CLIENT = false;
+ static final boolean USE_DEV_CLIENT = true;
```

To use `dev-client` when running `bare-expo` on iOS, open [AppDelegate.mm](/apps/bare-expo/ios/BareExpo/AppDelegate.mm) and set the `USE_DEV_CLIENT` value to `YES`.

```diff
- BOOL useDevClient = NO;
+ BOOL useDevClient = YES;
```

Then build the native apps with `npx pod-install && yarn ios` or `yarn android`.

### Making JavaScript changes inside the `app` folder

To update the JavaScript code inside the `app` folder, you need to run the `dev-menu` bundler locally.

1. Navigate to the `dev-menu` package: `cd packages/expo-dev-menu`
2. Start the Metro bundler: `yarn start`
3. To use your local bundler on Android, open [DevMenuHost.java](/packages/expo-dev-menu/android/src/debug/java/expo/modules/devmenu/DevMenuHost.kt) and set `getUseDeveloperSupport` to `true`.

```diff
- override fun getUseDeveloperSupport() = false
+ override fun getUseDeveloperSupport() = true
```

4. Play with your changes on a simulator or device through `bare-expo`
5. Once you've made all the necessary changes run `yarn bundle:prod:ios && yarn bundle:prod:android` to update the embedded bundle

# Importing native dependencies - autolinking

Many React Native libraries come with platform-specific (native) code. This native code has to be linked into the project and, in some cases, configured further. These actions require some modifications to the native project files. One of the steps that has to be done with the native configuration is to enable the autolinking mechanism that takes care of including any supported module's native code into the project. The following configuration is required:

### iOS

> Caution! After you have made the following changes you will need to run `pod install` again.

```ruby
# Podfile

require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"`), "scripts/react_native_pods")
require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"`), "cocoapods.rb")
require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"`), "scripts/autolinking")

#  ...

target "TargetName" do
  use_unimodules!
  config = use_native_modules!
  use_react_native!(:path => config["reactNativePath"])

  # ...
end
```

### Android

```groovy
// app/build.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy")
apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../react.gradle")
apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-updates/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle")

// ...

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle");
applyNativeModulesAppBuildGradle(project)
```

```groovy
// settings.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy");
includeUnimodulesProjects()

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle");
applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)
```

### Explanation

The scripts that are referenced in Gradle and Cocoapods are usually found the related package inside the project's `node_modules` directory. In the case of monorepos (such as Yarn workspaces) the project directory may not contain `node_modules` at all; instead, the modules are likely to be located at the root of the repository. In order to ensure that both cases are supported, we take advantage of the Node dependency resolution strategy. We invoke a subprocess that spawns the simple JavaScript snippet that tries to locate the desired npm package containing the script we need.

- On iOS, we use [`` ` ` `` (backtick)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3159945/running-command-line-commands-within-ruby-script) ([alternative reference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Kernel.html#method-i-60)).
- On Android, we use [String[]#execute](<http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String[].html#execute()>) to obtain the results from the subprocess' stdout.

The Node process that is spawned runs [`require.resolve`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to obtain the path to a module's `package.json`(if you look for the module location using solely module name, you'll be given the path to the file pointed by the `main` attribute from the `package.json` and we need to know the location of the module's root directory). We then assemble the path to the desired script and execute it.

You can read more about the scripts and libraries used in the examples above in their official READMEs.

- 🎨 set custom icon and color for notifications on Android.

# Installation in managed Expo projects

Please refer to the [installation instructions in the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/notifications/#installation).

# Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

### Add the package to your npm dependencies

```
npx expo install expo-notifications
```

### Configure for iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the npm package.

In order to be able to receive push notifications on the device:

- open Xcode workspace from your `ios` folder
- select your project from the _Navigator_ pane
- switch to _Signing & Capabilities_ tab
- ensure that the _Push notifications_ capability is present (if it's not, click the "+ Capability" button and add the capability to the project).

### Configure for Android

In order to be able to receive push notifications on the device ensure that your project is set up for Firebase. For more information on how to do it, see [this guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/setup-native-firebase/#bare-workflow-setup).

This module requires permission to subscribe to device boot. It's used to setup the scheduled notifications right after the device (re)starts. The `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` permission is added automatically.

**Note:** Starting from Android 12 (API level 31), to schedule the notification that triggers at the exact time, you need to add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"/>` to **AndroidManifest.xml**. You can read more about the exact alarm permission [here](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#exact-alarm-permission).

<details><summary><strong>Expand to view how the notification icon and the default color can be customized in a plain React Native app</strong></summary> <p>

- **To customize the icon**:

  You can customize two icons: the default and the large one. See [the Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications#Templates) for more details. The steps for them are very similar. The only difference is the tag in the second step.

  1. You will need to ensure that the icon is properly set up and added the project. To read more on how to create a notification icon and add it to the project check out the [“Create notification icon” section](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/image-asset-studio#create-notification) at the official Android guide. Remember the name you use for the icon asset, you will need it later!
  2. Then head over to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add a `<meta-data>` tag of `android:name="expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_icon"` (or `android:name="expo.modules.notifications.large_notification_icon"` if you are changing the large icon) inside the `<application>` node referencing the custom icon with `@drawable/<notification_icon_name_you_used_in_step_1>`, like [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/335e67a1a3a91598c02061f3318a881541d0d57a/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L44-L46).
  3. In the end your `AndroidManifest.xml` should look more or less like this:

  ```xml
  <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" ...>
    ...
    <application ...>
      ...
      <meta-data
        android:name="expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_icon"
        android:resource="@drawable/ic_stat_notifications" /> <!-- @drawable/<insert_notification_icon_name> -->
      ...
    </application>
  </manifest>
  ```

- **To customize the default color of the notification**:
  1. you will need a color resource added to the native project's resources. Some information on how to do this can be found in [the official Android guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/more-resources#Color). The most simple and fail-safe instructions would be to:
     1. ensure that there is a file under `android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml` (if there is none, create it)
     2. ensure that it's a valid resources XML file (it should start with a `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>` declaration and have a root node of `<resources>`)
     3. inside the `<resources>` node add a `<color>` node with an arbitrary name (like `notification_icon_color`) containing the color in HEX format inside, like [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/335e67a1a3a91598c02061f3318a881541d0d57a/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml#L3).
     4. in the end your `colors.xml` should look more or less like this:
        ```java
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <resources>
          <color name="notification_icon_color">#4630EB</color>
        </resources>
        ```
  2. now, when the color is added to the project, we need to configure `expo-notifications` to use it when it displays a notification — head over to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add a `<meta-data>` tag of `android:name="expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_color"` inside the `<application>` node referencing the custom icon with `@color/<notification_icon_color_name>`, like [here](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/335e67a1a3a91598c02061f3318a881541d0d57a/apps/bare-expo/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L47-L49).
  3. In the end your `AndroidManifest.xml` should look more or less like this:
  ```xml
  <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" ...>
    ...
    <application ...>
      ...
      <meta-data
        android:name="expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_color"
        android:resource="@color/notification_icon_color" /> <!-- @color/<insert_notification_icon_color_name> -->
      ...
    </application>
  </manifest>
  ```
- An `AndroidManifest.xml` with both color (of name `notification_icon_color`) and an icon (of name `ic_stat_notifications`) name would look like this:
  ```xml
  <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" ...>
    <application ...>
      ...
      <meta-data
        android:name="expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_icon"
        android:resource="@drawable/ic_stat_notifications" />
      <meta-data
        android:name="expo.modules.notifications.default_notification_color"
        android:resource="@color/notification_icon_color" />
      ...
    </application>

### Config plugin setup (optional)

If you're using EAS Build, you can set your Android notification icon and color tint, add custom push notification sounds, and set your iOS notification environment using the expo-notifications config plugin ([what's a config plugin?](https://docs.expo.dev/home/config-plugins/introduction)). To setup, just add the config plugin to the plugins array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js` as shown below, then rebuild the app.

```json
{
  "expo": {
    ...
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "icon": "./local/path/to/myNotificationIcon.png",
          "color": "#ffffff",
          "sounds": ["./local/path/to/mySound.wav", "./local/path/to/myOtherSound.wav"],
          "mode": "production"
        }
      ]
    ],
  }
}
```

<details><summary><strong>Expand to view property descriptions and default values</strong></summary> <p>

- **icon**: Android only. Local path to an image to use as the icon for push notifications. 96x96 all-white png with transparency.
- **color**: Android only. Tint color for the push notification image when it appears in the notification tray. Default: "#ffffff".
- **sounds**: Array of local paths to sound files (.wav recommended) that can be used as custom notification sounds.
- **mode**: iOS only. Environment of the app: either 'development' or 'production'. Default: 'development'.

</p>
</details>

### Add your project's credentials to Expo server (optional)

If you would like to send notifications with Expo servers, the servers will need to have a way to authenticate with APNS/FCM that they are authorized to send notifications on your behalf. To do this:

- for Firebase Cloud Messaging, check out this guide: _[Uploading Server Credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/using-fcm/#uploading-server-credentials)_,
- for APNS:
  - run `expo credentials:manager` in the root of your application,
  - if you've already uploaded a Push Notifications Key in another project and would like to reuse it in the current project, select _Use existing Push Notifications Key in current project_ (you may need to set `slug` and `ios.bundleIdentifier` fields in `app.json` so that the server knows to which `experienceId` and `bundleIdentifier` the key should be attributed),
  - if you've never uploaded a Push Notifications Key or would like to add a new one
    - select _Add new Push Notifications Key_
    - if you'd like to let Expo handle the process, select _Let Expo handle the process_
    - if you can't let Expo handle the process or you want to upload your own key, select _I want to upload my own file_
      - provide a path to the P8 file you have downloaded from [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/) website.

# Common gotchas / known issues

### Fetching a push token takes a long time on iOS

`getDevicePushTokenAsync` and `getExpoPushTokenAsync` can sometimes take a long time to resolve on iOS. This is outside of `expo-notifications`'s control, as stated in Apple's [“Troubleshooting Push Notifications” technical note](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2265/_index.html):

> This is not necessarily an error condition. The system may not have Internet connectivity at all because it is out of range of any cell towers or Wi-Fi access points, or it may be in airplane mode. Instead of treating this as an error, your app should continue normally, disabling only that functionality that relies on push notifications.

As mentioned, the most common reasons for this this are either an invalid Internet connection (fetching a push token requires an Internet connection to register the device with the service provider) or an invalid configuration of your App ID or Provisioning Profile.

Here are a few ways people claim to have solved this problem, maybe one of these will help you solve it, too!

<details><summary><strong>Read the Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2265/_index.html">Technical Note on troubleshooting push notifications</a></strong></summary> <p>

Go read the Apple's [Technical Note on troubleshooting push notifications](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2265/_index.html)! This the single most reliable source of information on this problem. To help you grasp what they're suggesting:

- Make sure the device has a reliable connection to the Internet (try turning off Wi-Fi or switching to another network, and disabling firewall block on port 5223, as suggested in [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34332047/1123156)).
- Make sure your app configuration is set properly for registering for push notifications (for bare workflow check out [this guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html), for managed workflow this is done automatically for you by `expo-cli`) as also suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10791240/1123156).
- If you're in bare workflow you may want to try to debug this even further by logging persistent connection debug information as outlined by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8036052/1123156).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Try again in a little while</strong></summary> <p>

- APNS servers near the device may be down as indicated by [this forum thread](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/52224). Take a walk and try again later!
- Try again in a few days time as suggested by [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/10369#issuecomment-717872956).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Disable network sharing on your device</strong></summary> <p>

You may need to disable network sharing as this may impact the registration as suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59156989/1123156).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Restart your device</strong></summary> <p>

If you just changed the APNS servers where the app should be registering (by installing a TestFlight build over an Xcode build on the same device) you may need to restart your device as suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59864028/1123156).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Setup your device with a SIM card</strong></summary> <p>

If the device you're experiencing this on hasn't been setup with a SIM card it looks like configuring it may help mitigate this bug as suggested by [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19432504/1123156).

</p>
</details>

### Setting custom notification sounds

Custom notification sounds are only supported when using [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/), or in the bare workflow.

To add custom push notification sounds to your app, add the `expo-notifications` plugin to your `app.json` file:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "expo-notifications",
        {
          "sounds": ["local/path/to/mySoundFile.wav"]
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

After building your app, the array of files will be available for use in both [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput) and [`NotificationChannelInput`](#notificationchannelinput). You _only_ need to provide the base filename- here's an example using the config above:

```ts
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new-emails', {
  name: 'E-mail notifications',
  sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
});

await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    sound: 'mySoundFile.wav', // Provide ONLY the base filename
  },
  trigger: {
    seconds: 2,
    channelId: 'new-emails',
  },
});
```

You can also manually add notification files to your Android and iOS projects if you prefer:

<details><summary><strong>Manually adding notification sounds on Android</strong></summary> <p>

On Androids 8.0+, playing a custom sound for a notification requires more than setting the `sound` property on the `NotificationContentInput`. You will _also_ need to configure the `NotificationChannel` with the appropriate `sound`, and use it when sending/scheduling the notification.

For the example below to work, you would place your `email-sound.wav` file in `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`.

```ts
// Prepare the notification channel
await Notifications.setNotificationChannelAsync('new-emails', {
  name: 'E-mail notifications',
  importance: Notifications.AndroidImportance.HIGH,
  sound: 'email-sound.wav', // <- for Android 8.0+, see channelId property below
});

// Eg. schedule the notification
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
    sound: 'email-sound.wav', // <- for Android below 8.0
  },
  trigger: {
    seconds: 2,
    channelId: 'new-emails', // <- for Android 8.0+, see definition above
  },
});
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Manually adding notification sounds on iOS</strong></summary> <p>

On iOS, all that's needed is to place your sound file in your Xcode project, and then specify the sound file in your `NotificationContentInput`, like this:

```ts
await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "You've got mail! 📬",
    body: 'Open the notification to read them all',
    sound: 'notification.wav',
  },
  trigger: {
    // ...
  },
});
```

## Custom notification icon and colors (Android only)

Setting a default icon and color for all of your app's notifications is almost too easy. In the managed workflow, just set your [`notification.icon`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#notification) and [`notification.color`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#notification) keys in `app.json`, and rebuild your app! In the bare workflow, you'll need to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-notifications#configure-for-android).

For your notification icon, make sure you follow [Google's design guidelines](https://material.io/design/iconography/product-icons.html#design-principles) (the icon must be all white with a transparent background) or else it may not be displayed as intended.

In both the managed and bare workflow, you can also set a custom notification color _per-notification_ directly in your [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput) under the `color` attribute.

## Android push notification payload specification

When sending a push notification, put an object conforming to the following type as `data` of the notification:

```ts
export interface FirebaseData {
  title?: string;
  message?: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  sound?: boolean | string;
  vibrate?: boolean | number[];
  priority?: AndroidNotificationPriority;
  badge?: number;
}
```

## Fetching tokens for push notifications

### `getExpoPushTokenAsync(options: ExpoTokenOptions): ExpoPushToken`

Returns an Expo token that can be used to send a push notification to this device using Expo push notifications service. [Read more in the Push Notifications guide](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/push-notifications/).

> **Note:** For Expo's backend to be able to send notifications to your app, you will need to provide it with push notification keys. This can be done using `expo-cli` (`expo credentials:manager`). [Read more in the “Upload notifications credentials” guide](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/push-notifications-setup/#credentials).

> **Note:** Especially on iOS, `Promise`s returned by this method may take longer periods of time to fulfill. For more information see [Fetching a push token takes a long time on iOS](#fetching-a-push-token-takes-a-long-time-on-ios).

#### Arguments

This function accepts an optional object allowing you to pass in configuration, consisting of fields (all are optional, but some may have to be defined if configuration cannot be inferred):

- **experienceId (_string_)** -- The ID of the experience to which the token should be attributed. Defaults to [`Constants.manifest.id`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/constants/#constantsmanifest) exposed by `expo-constants`. In the bare workflow, you must provide a value which takes the shape `@username/projectSlug`, where `username` is the Expo account that the project is associated with, and `projectSlug` is your [`slug` from `app.json`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/config/app/#slug).
- **devicePushToken ([_DevicePushToken_](#devicepushtoken))** -- The device push token with which to register at the backend. Defaults to a token fetched with [`getDevicePushTokenAsync()`](#getdevicepushtokenasync-devicepushtoken).
- **applicationId (_string_)** -- The ID of the application to which the token should be attributed. Defaults to [`Application.applicationId`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/application/#applicationapplicationid) exposed by `expo-application`.
- **development (_boolean_)** -- Makes sense only on iOS, where there are two push notification services: sandbox and production. This defines whether the push token is supposed to be used with the sandbox platform notification service. Defaults to [`Application.getIosPushNotificationServiceEnvironmentAsync()`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/application/#applicationgetiospushnotificationserviceenvironmentasync) exposed by `expo-application` or `false`. Most probably you won't need to customize that. You may want to customize that if you don't want to install `expo-application` and still use the sandbox APNS.

#### Returns

Returns a `Promise` that resolves to an object with the following fields:

- **type (_string_)** -- Always `expo`.
- **data (_string_)** -- The push token as a string.

#### Examples

##### Fetching the Expo push token and uploading it to a server

```ts
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export async function registerForPushNotificationsAsync(userId: string) {
  let experienceId = undefined;
  if (!Constants.manifest) {
    // Absence of the manifest means we're in bare workflow
    experienceId = '@username/example';
  }
  const expoPushToken = await Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync({
    experienceId,
  });
  await fetch('https://example.com/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userId,
      expoPushToken,
    }),
  });
}
```

### `getDevicePushTokenAsync(): DevicePushToken`

Returns a native APNS, FCM token or a [`PushSubscription` data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription) that can be used with another push notification service.

> **Note:** Especially on iOS, `Promise`s returned by this method may take longer periods of time to fulfill. For more information see [Fetching a push token takes a long time on iOS](#fetching-a-push-token-takes-a-long-time-on-ios) section of the documentation.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to an object with the following fields:

- **type (_string_)** -- Either `ios`, `android` or `web`.
- **data (_string_ or _object_)** -- Either the push token as a string (for `type == "ios" | "android"`) or an object conforming to the type below (for `type == "web"`):
  ```ts
  {
    endpoint: string;
    keys: {
      p256dh: string;
      auth: string;
    }
  }
  ```

### `addPushTokenListener(listener: PushTokenListener): Subscription`

In rare situations a push token may be changed by the push notification service while the app is running. When a token is rolled, the old one becomes invalid and sending notifications to it will fail. A push token listener will let you handle this situation gracefully by registering the new token with your backend right away.

#### Arguments

A single and required argument is a function accepting a push token as an argument. It will be called whenever the push token changes.

#### Returns

A [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.

#### Examples

Registering a push token listener using a React hook

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

import { registerDevicePushTokenAsync } from '../api';

export default function App() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Notifications.addPushTokenListener(registerDevicePushTokenAsync);
    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your app content
  );
}
```

### `removePushTokenSubscription(subscription: Subscription): void`

Removes a push token subscription returned by a `addPushTokenListener` call.

#### Arguments

A single and required argument is a subscription returned by `addPushTokenListener`.

## Listening to notification events

Notification events include incoming notifications, interactions your users perform with notifications (this can be tapping on a notification, or interacting with it via [notification categories](#managing-notification-categories-interactive-notifications)), and rare occasions when your notifications may be dropped.

A few different listeners are exposed, so we've provided a chart below which will hopefully help you understand when you can expect each one to be triggered:

| User interacted with notification? | App state  | Listener(s) triggered                                                   |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| false                              | Foreground | `NotificationReceivedListener`                                          |
| false                              | Background | `BackgroundNotificationTask`                                            |
| false                              |   Killed   | none                                                                    |
| true                               | Foreground | `NotificationReceivedListener` & `NotificationResponseReceivedListener` |
| true                               | Background | `NotificationResponseReceivedListener`                                  |
| true                               |   Killed   | `NotificationResponseReceivedListener`                                  |

> In the chart above, whenever `NotificationResponseReceivedListener` is triggered, the same would apply to the `useLastNotificationResponse` hook.

### `useLastNotificationResponse(): undefined | NotificationResponse | null`

A React hook always returning the notification response that was received most recently (a notification response designates an interaction with a notification, such as tapping on it).

> If you don't want to use a hook, you can use `Notifications.getLastNotificationResponseAsync()` instead.

#### Returns

The hook may return one of these three types/values:

- `undefined` -- until we're sure of what to return
- `null` -- if no notification response has been received yet
- a [`NotificationResponse`](#notificationresponse) object -- if a notification response was received

#### Examples

Responding to a notification tap by opening a URL that could be put into the notification's `data` (opening the URL is your responsibility and is not a part of the `expo-notifications` API):

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import { Linking } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const lastNotificationResponse = Notifications.useLastNotificationResponse();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (
      lastNotificationResponse &&
      lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url &&
      lastNotificationResponse.actionIdentifier === Notifications.DEFAULT_ACTION_IDENTIFIER
    ) {
      Linking.openURL(lastNotificationResponse.notification.request.content.data.url);
    }
  }, [lastNotificationResponse]);

  return (
    /*
     * your app
     */
  );
}
```

### `addNotificationReceivedListener(listener: (event: Notification) => void): void`

Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever a notification is received while the app is running.

#### Arguments

A single and required argument is a function accepting a notification ([`Notification`](#notification)) as an argument.

#### Returns

A [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.

#### Examples

Registering a notification listener using a React hook

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export default function App() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationReceivedListener(notification => {
      console.log(notification);
    });
    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your app content
  );
}
```

### `addNotificationsDroppedListener(listener: () => void): void`

Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever some notifications have been dropped by the server. Applicable only to Firebase Cloud Messaging which we use as notifications service on Android. It corresponds to `onDeletedMessages()` callback. [More information can be found in Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive#override-ondeletedmessages).

#### Arguments

A single and required argument is a function–callback.

#### Returns

A [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.

### `addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(listener: (event: NotificationResponse) => void): void`

Listeners registered by this method will be called whenever a user interacts with a notification (eg. taps on it).

#### Arguments

A single and required argument is a function accepting notification response ([`NotificationResponse`](#notificationresponse)) as an argument.

#### Returns

A [`Subscription`](#subscription) object representing the subscription of the provided listener.

#### Examples

##### Registering a notification listener using a React hook

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Linking } from 'react-native';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export default function Container() {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener(response => {
      const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;
      Linking.openUrl(url);
    });
    return () => subscription.remove();
  }, []);

  return (
    // Your app content
  );
}
```

##### Handling push notifications with React Navigation

If you'd like to deep link to a specific screen in your app when you receive a push notification, you can configure React Navigation's [linking](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-container#linking) prop to do that:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Linking } from 'react-native';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer
      linking={{
        config: {
          // Configuration for linking
        },
        subscribe(listener) {
          const onReceiveURL = ({ url }: { url: string }) => listener(url);

          // Listen to incoming links from deep linking
          Linking.addEventListener('url', onReceiveURL);

          // Listen to expo push notifications
          const subscription = Notifications.addNotificationResponseReceivedListener((response) => {
            const url = response.notification.request.content.data.url;

            // Any custom logic to see whether the URL needs to be handled
            //...

            // Let React Navigation handle the URL
            listener(url);
          });

          return () => {
            // Clean up the event listeners
            Linking.removeEventListener('url', onReceiveURL);
            subscription.remove();
          };
        },
      }}>
      {/* Your app content */}
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

See more details on [React Navigation documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/deep-linking/#third-party-integrations).

### `removeNotificationSubscription(subscription: Subscription): void`

Removes a notification subscription returned by a `addNotification*Listener` call.

#### Arguments

A single and required argument is a subscription returned by `addNotification*Listener`.

## Handling incoming notifications when the app is in foreground

### `setNotificationHandler(handler: NotificationHandler | null): void`

When a notification is received while the app is running, using this function you can set a callback that will decide whether the notification should be shown to the user or not.

When a notification is received, `handleNotification` is called with the incoming notification as an argument. The function should respond with a behavior object within 3 seconds, otherwise the notification will be discarded. If the notification is handled successfully, `handleSuccess` is called with the identifier of the notification, otherwise (or on timeout) `handleError` will be called.

The default behavior when the handler is not set or does not respond in time is not to show the notification.

#### Arguments

The function receives a single argument which should be either `null` (if you want to clear the handler) or an object of fields:

- **handleNotification (_(Notification) => Promise<NotificationBehavior>_**) -- (required) a function accepting an incoming notification returning a `Promise` resolving to a behavior ([`NotificationBehavior`](#notificationbehavior)) applicable to the notification
- **handleSuccess (_(notificationId: string) => void_)** -- (optional) a function called whenever an incoming notification is handled successfully
- **handleError (_(error: Error) => void_)** -- (optional) a function called whenever handling of an incoming notification fails

#### Examples

Implementing a notification handler that always shows the notification when it is received

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
  }),
});
```

## Handling incoming notifications when the app is not in the foreground (not supported in Expo Go)

> **Please note:** In order to handle notifications while the app is backgrounded on iOS, you _must_ add `remote-notification` to the `ios.infoPlist.UIBackgroundModes` key in your app.json, **and** add `"content-available": 1` to your push notification payload. Under normal circumstances, the “content-available” flag should launch your app if it isn’t running and wasn’t killed by the user, _however_, this is ultimately decided by the OS so it might not always happen.

### `registerTaskAsync(taskName: string): void`

When a notification is received while the app is backgrounded, using this function you can set a callback that will be run in response to that notification. Under the hood, this function is run using `expo-task-manager`. You **must** define the task _first_, with [`TaskManager.defineTask`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/task-manager/#taskmanagerdefinetasktaskname-task). Make sure you define it in the global scope.

The `taskName` argument is the string you passed to `TaskManager.defineTask` as the "taskName". The callback function you define with `TaskManager.defineTask` will receive the following arguments:

- **data**: The remote payload delivered by either FCM (Android) or APNs (iOS). [See here for details](#pushnotificationtrigger).
- **error**: The error (if any) that occurred during execution of the task.
- **executionInfo**: JSON object of additional info related to the task, including the `taskName`.

#### Examples

```ts
import * as TaskManager from 'expo-task-manager';
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

const BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK = 'BACKGROUND-NOTIFICATION-TASK';

TaskManager.defineTask(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK, ({ data, error, executionInfo }) => {
  console.log('Received a notification in the background!');
  // Do something with the notification data
});

Notifications.registerTaskAsync(BACKGROUND_NOTIFICATION_TASK);
```

### `unregisterTaskAsync(taskName: string): void`

Used to unregister tasks registered with `registerTaskAsync`.

## Fetching information about notifications-related permissions

### `getPermissionsAsync(): Promise<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`

Calling this function checks current permissions settings related to notifications. It lets you verify whether the app is currently allowed to display alerts, play sounds, etc. There is no user-facing effect of calling this.

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise` resolving to an object representing permission settings (`NotificationPermissionsStatus`).

#### Examples

Check if the app is allowed to send any type of notifications (interrupting and non-interrupting–provisional on iOS)

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export async function allowsNotificationsAsync() {
  const settings = await Notifications.getPermissionsAsync();
  return (
    settings.granted || settings.ios?.status === Notifications.IosAuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL
  );
}
```

### `requestPermissionsAsync(request?: NotificationPermissionsRequest): Promise<NotificationPermissionsStatus>`

Prompts the user for notification permissions according to request. **Request defaults to asking the user to allow displaying alerts, setting badge count and playing sounds**.

#### Arguments

An optional object of conforming to the following interface:

```ts
{
  android?: {};
  ios?: {
    allowAlert?: boolean;
    allowBadge?: boolean;
    allowSound?: boolean;
    allowDisplayInCarPlay?: boolean;
    allowCriticalAlerts?: boolean;
    provideAppNotificationSettings?: boolean;
    allowProvisional?: boolean;
    allowAnnouncements?: boolean;
  }
}
```

Each option corresponds to a different native platform authorization option (a list of iOS options is available [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unauthorizationoptions), on Android all available permissions are granted by default and if a user declines any permission an app can't prompt the user to change).

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise` resolving to an object representing permission settings (`NotificationPermissionsStatus`).

#### Examples

Prompts the user to allow the app to show alerts, play sounds, set badge count and let Siri read out messages through AirPods

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

export function requestPermissionsAsync() {
  return await Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync({
    ios: {
      allowAlert: true,
      allowBadge: true,
      allowSound: true,
      allowAnnouncements: true,
    },
  });
}
```

## Managing application badge icon

### `getBadgeCountAsync(): Promise<number>`

Fetches the number currently set as the badge of the app icon on device's home screen. A `0` value means that the badge is not displayed.

> **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will always resolve to `0`.

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise` resolving to a number representing current badge of the app icon.

### `setBadgeCountAsync(badgeCount: number, options?: SetBadgeCountOptions): Promise<boolean>`

Sets the badge of the app's icon to the specified number. Setting to `0` clears the badge.

> **Note:** Not all Android launchers support application badges. If the launcher does not support icon badges, the method will resolve to `false`.

#### Arguments

The function accepts a number as the first argument. A value of `0` will clear the badge.

As a second, optional argument you can pass in an object of options configuring behavior applied in Web environment. The object should be of format:

```ts
{
  web?: badgin.Options
}
```

where the type `badgin.Options` is an object described [in the `badgin`'s documentation](https://github.com/jaulz/badgin#options).

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise` resolving to a boolean representing whether setting of the badge succeeded.

## Scheduling notifications

### `getAllScheduledNotificationsAsync(): Promise<Notification[]>`

Fetches information about all scheduled notifications.

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise` resolving to an array of objects conforming to the [`Notification`](#notification) interface.

### `presentNotificationAsync(content: NotificationContentInput, identifier?: string): Promise<string>`

Schedules a notification for immediate trigger.

> **Note:** This method has been deprecated in favor of using an explicit `NotificationHandler` and the `scheduleNotificationAsync` method. More info may be found at https://expo.fyi/presenting-notifications-deprecated.

#### Arguments

The only argument to this function is a [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput).

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise` resolving with the notification's identifier once the notification is successfully scheduled for immediate display.

#### Examples

##### Presenting the notification to the user (deprecated way)

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.presentNotificationAsync({
  title: 'Look at that notification',
  body: "I'm so proud of myself!",
});
```

##### Presenting the notification to the user (recommended way)

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

// First, set the handler that will cause the notification
// to show the alert

Notifications.setNotificationHandler({
  handleNotification: async () => ({
    shouldShowAlert: true,
    shouldPlaySound: false,
    shouldSetBadge: false,
  }),
});

// Second, call the method

Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: 'Look at that notification',
    body: "I'm so proud of myself!",
  },
  trigger: null,
});
```

### `scheduleNotificationAsync(notificationRequest: NotificationRequestInput): Promise<string>`

Schedules a notification to be triggered in the future.

> **Note:** Please note that this does not mean that the notification will be presented when it is triggered. For the notification to be presented you have to set a notification handler with [`setNotificationHandler`](#setnotificationhandlerhandler-notificationhandler--null-void) that will return an appropriate notification behavior. For more information see the example below.

#### Arguments

The one and only argument to this method is a [`NotificationRequestInput`](#notificationrequestinput) describing the notification to be triggered.

#### Returns

It returns a `Promise` resolving to a string --- a notification identifier you can later use to cancel the notification or to identify an incoming notification.

#### Examples

##### Scheduling the notification that will trigger once, in one minute from now

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: "Time's up!",
    body: 'Change sides!',
  },
  trigger: {
    seconds: 60,
  },
});
```

##### Scheduling the notification that will trigger repeatedly, every 20 minutes

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: 'Remember to drink water!,
  },
  trigger: {
    seconds: 60 * 20,
    repeats: true
  },
});
```

##### Scheduling the notification that will trigger once, at the beginning of next hour

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

const trigger = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000);
trigger.setMinutes(0);
trigger.setSeconds(0);

Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: 'Happy new hour!',
  },
  trigger,
});
```

### `cancelScheduledNotificationAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`

Cancels a single scheduled notification. The scheduled notification of given ID will not trigger.

#### Arguments

The notification identifier with which `scheduleNotificationAsync` resolved when the notification has been scheduled.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving once the scheduled notification is successfully cancelled or if there is no scheduled notification for given identifier.

#### Examples

##### Scheduling and then canceling the notification

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

async function scheduleAndCancel() {
  const identifier = await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: 'Hey!',
    },
    trigger: { seconds: 5, repeats: true },
  });
  await Notifications.cancelScheduledNotificationAsync(identifier);
}
```

### `cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync(): Promise<void>`

Cancels all scheduled notifications.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving once all the scheduled notifications are successfully cancelled or if there are no scheduled notifications.

### `getNextTriggerDateAsync(trigger: SchedulableNotificationTriggerInput): Promise<number | null>`

Allows you to check what will be the next trigger date for given notification trigger input.

#### Arguments

The schedulable notification trigger you would like to check next trigger date for (of type [`SchedulableNotificationTriggerInput`](#schedulablenotificationtriggerinput)).

#### Returns

If the return value is `null`, the notification won't be triggered. Otherwise, the return value is the Unix timestamp in milliseconds at which the notification will be triggered.

#### Examples

##### Calculating next trigger date for a notification trigger

```ts
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications';

async function logNextTriggerDate() {
  try {
    const nextTriggerDate = await Notifications.getNextTriggerDateAsync({
      hour: 9,
      minute: 0,
    });
    console.log(nextTriggerDate === null ? 'No next trigger date' : new Date(nextTriggerDate));
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn(`Couldn't have calculated next trigger date: ${e}`);
  }
}
```

## Dismissing notifications

### `getPresentedNotificationsAsync(): Promise<Notification[]>`

Fetches information about all notifications present in the notification tray (Notification Center).

> **Note:** This method is not supported on Android below 6.0 (API level 23) – on these devices it will resolve to an empty array.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving with a list of notifications ([`Notification`](#notification)) currently present in the notification tray (Notification Center).

### `dismissNotificationAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`

Removes notification displayed in the notification tray (Notification Center).

#### Arguments

The first and only argument to the function is the notification identifier, obtained either in `setNotificationHandler` or in the listener added with `addNotificationReceivedListener`.

#### Returns

Resolves once the request to dismiss the notification is successfully dispatched to the notifications manager.

### `dismissAllNotificationsAsync(): Promise<void>`

Removes all application's notifications displayed in the notification tray (Notification Center).

#### Returns

Resolves once the request to dismiss the notifications is successfully dispatched to the notifications manager.

## Managing notification channels (Android-specific)

> Starting in Android 8.0 (API level 26), all notifications must be assigned to a channel. For each channel, you can set the visual and auditory behavior that is applied to all notifications in that channel. Then, users can change these settings and decide which notification channels from your app should be intrusive or visible at all. [(source: developer.android.com)](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels)

If you do not specify a notification channel, `expo-notifications` will create a fallback channel for you, named _Miscellaneous_. We encourage you to always ensure appropriate channels with informative names are set up for the application and to always send notifications to these channels.

Calling these methods is a no-op for platforms that do not support this feature (iOS, Web and Android below version 8.0 (26)).

### `getNotificationChannelsAsync(): Promise<NotificationChannel[]>`

Fetches information about all known notification channels.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to an array of channels. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to an empty array.

### `getNotificationChannelAsync(identifier: string): Promise<NotificationChannel | null>`

Fetches information about a single notification channel.

#### Arguments

The only argument to this method is the channel's identifier.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to the channel object (of type [`NotificationChannel`](#notificationchannel)) or to `null` if there was no channel found for this identifier. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to `null`.

### `setNotificationChannelAsync(identifier: string, channel: NotificationChannelInput): Promise<NotificationChannel | null>`

Assigns the channel configuration to a channel of a specified name (creating it if need be). This method lets you assign given notification channel to a notification channel group.

> **Note:** For some settings to be applied on all Android versions, it may be necessary to duplicate the configuration across both a single notification _and_ it's respective notification channel. For example, for a notification to play a custom sound on Android versions **below** 8.0, the custom notification sound has to be set on the notification (through the [`NotificationContentInput`](#notificationcontentinput)), and for the custom sound to play on Android versions **above** 8.0, the relevant notification channel must have the custom sound configured (through the [`NotificationChannelInput`](#notificationchannelinput)). For more information, see ["Setting custom notification sounds on Android"](#setting-custom-notification-sounds-on-android).

#### Arguments

First argument to the method is the channel identifier.

Second argument is the channel's configuration of type [`NotificationChannelInput`](#notificationchannelinput)

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to the object (of type [`NotificationChannel`](#notificationchannel)) describing the modified channel or to `null` if the platform does not support notification channels.

### `deleteNotificationChannelAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`

Removes the notification channel.

#### Arguments

First and only argument to the method is the channel identifier.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving once the channel is removed (or if there was no channel for given identifier).

### `getNotificationChannelGroupsAsync(): Promise<NotificationChannelGroup[]>`

Fetches information about all known notification channel groups.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to an array of channel groups. On platforms that do not support notification channel groups, it will always resolve to an empty array.

### `getNotificationChannelGroupAsync(identifier: string): Promise<NotificationChannelGroup | null>`

Fetches information about a single notification channel group.

#### Arguments

The only argument to this method is the channel group's identifier.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to the channel group object (of type [`NotificationChannelGroup`](#notificationchannelgroup)) or to `null` if there was no channel group found for this identifier. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to `null`.

### `setNotificationChannelGroupAsync(identifier: string, channel: NotificationChannelGroupInput): Promise<NotificationChannelGroup | null>`

Assigns the channel group configuration to a channel group of a specified name (creating it if need be).

#### Arguments

First argument to the method is the channel group identifier.

Second argument is the channel group's configuration of type [`NotificationChannelGroupInput`](#notificationchannelgroupinput)

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to the object (of type [`NotificationChannelGroup`](#notificationchannelgroup)) describing the modified channel group or to `null` if the platform does not support notification channels.

### `deleteNotificationChannelGroupAsync(identifier: string): Promise<void>`

Removes the notification channel group and all notification channels that belong to it.

#### Arguments

First and only argument to the method is the channel group identifier.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving once the channel group is removed (or if there was no channel group for given identifier).

## Managing notification categories (interactive notifications)

Notification categories allow you to create interactive push notifications, so that a user can respond directly to the incoming notification either via buttons or a text response. A category defines the set of actions a user can take, and then those actions are applied to a notification by specifying the `categoryIdentifier` in the [`NotificationContent`](#notificationcontent).

On iOS, notification categories also allow you to customize your notifications further. With each category, not only can you set interactive actions a user can take, but you can also configure things like the placeholder text to display when the user disables notification previews for your app.

Calling one of the following methods is a no-op on Web.

### `setNotificationCategoryAsync(identifier: string, actions: NotificationAction[], options: CategoryOptions): Promise<NotificationCategory | null>`

#### Arguments

- `identifier`: A string to associate as the ID of this category. You will pass this string in as the `categoryIdentifier` in your [`NotificationContent`](#notificationcontent) to associate a notification with this category.
- `actions`: An array of [`NotificationAction`s](#notificationaction), which describe the actions associated with this category. Each of these actions takes the shape:
  - `identifier`: A unique string that identifies this action. If a user takes this action (i.e. selects this button in the system's Notification UI), your app will receive this `actionIdentifier` via the [`NotificationResponseReceivedListener`](#addnotificationresponsereceivedlistenerlistener-event-notificationresponse--void-void).
  - `buttonTitle`: The title of the button triggering this action.
  - `textInput`: **Optional** object which, if provided, will result in a button that prompts the user for a text response.
    - `submitButtonTitle`: (**iOS only**) A string which will be used as the title for the button used for submitting the text response.
    - `placeholder`: A string that serves as a placeholder until the user begins typing. Defaults to no placeholder string.
  - `options`: **Optional** object of additional configuration options.
    - `opensAppToForeground`: Boolean indicating whether triggering this action foregrounds the app (defaults to `true`). If `false` and your app is killed (not just backgrounded), [`NotificationResponseReceived` listeners](#addnotificationresponsereceivedlistenerlistener-event-notificationresponse--void-void) will not be triggered when a user selects this action.
    - `isAuthenticationRequired`: (**iOS only**) Boolean indicating whether triggering the action will require authentication from the user.
    - `isDestructive`: (**iOS only**) Boolean indicating whether the button title will be highlighted a different color (usually red). This usually signifies a destructive action such as deleting data.
- `options`: An optional object of additional configuration options for your category (**these are all iOS only**):
  - `previewPlaceholder`: Customizable placeholder for the notification preview text. This is shown if the user has disabled notification previews for the app. Defaults to the localized iOS system default placeholder (`Notification`).
  - `intentIdentifiers`: Array of [Intent Class Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/intent_class_identifiers). When a notification is delivered, the presence of an intent identifier lets the system know that the notification is potentially related to the handling of a request made through Siri. Defaults to an empty array.
  - `categorySummaryFormat`: A format string for the summary description used when the system groups the category’s notifications.
  - `customDismissAction`: A boolean indicating whether to send actions for handling when the notification is dismissed (the user must explicitly dismiss the notification interface- ignoring a notification or flicking away a notification banner does not trigger this action). Defaults to `false`.
  - `allowInCarPlay`: A boolean indicating whether to allow CarPlay to display notifications of this type. **Apps must be approved for CarPlay to make use of this feature.** Defaults to `false`.
  - `showTitle`: A boolean indicating whether to show the notification's title, even if the user has disabled notification previews for the app. Defaults to `false`.
  - `showSubtitle`: A boolean indicating whether to show the notification's subtitle, even if the user has disabled notification previews for the app. Defaults to `false`.
  - `allowAnnouncement`: A boolean indicating whether to allow notifications to be automatically read by Siri when the user is using AirPods. Defaults to `false`.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to the category you just created.

### `getNotificationCategoriesAsync(): Promise<NotificationCategory[]>`

Fetches information about all known notification categories.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to an array of `NotificationCategory`s. On platforms that do not support notification channels, it will always resolve to an empty array.

### `deleteNotificationCategoryAsync(identifier: string): Promise<boolean>`

Deletes the category associated with the provided identifier.

#### Arguments

Identifier initially provided to `setNotificationCategoryAsync` when creating the category.

#### Returns

A `Promise` resolving to `true` if the category was successfully deleted, or `false` if it was not. An example of when this method would return `false` is if you try to delete a category that doesn't exist.

## Types

### `DevicePushToken`

In simple terms, an object of `type: Platform.OS` and `data: any`. The `data` type depends on the environment -- on a native device it will be a string, which you can then use to send notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging (Android) or APNS (iOS); on web it will be a registration object (VAPID).

```ts
export interface NativeDevicePushToken {
  type: 'ios' | 'android';
  data: string;
}

export interface WebDevicePushToken {
  type: 'web';
  data: {
    endpoint: string;
    keys: {
      p256dh: string;
      auth: string;
    };
  };
}

export type DevicePushToken = NativeDevicePushToken | WebDevicePushToken;
```

### `PushTokenListener`

A function accepting a device push token ([`DevicePushToken`](#devicepushtoken)) as an argument.

> **Note:** You should not call `getDevicePushTokenAsync` inside this function, as it triggers the listener and may lead to an infinite loop.

### `ExpoPushToken`

Borrowing from `DevicePushToken` a little bit, it's an object of `type: 'expo'` and `data: string`. You can use the `data` value to send notifications via Expo Notifications service.

```ts
export interface ExpoPushToken {
  type: 'expo';
  data: string;
}
```

### `Subscription`

A common-in-React-Native type to abstract an active subscription. Call `.remove()` to remove the subscription. You can then discard the object.

```ts
export type Subscription = {
  remove: () => void;
};
```

### `Notification`

An object representing a single notification that has been triggered by some request ([`NotificationRequest`](#notificationrequest)) at some point in time.

```ts
export interface Notification {
  date: number;
  request: NotificationRequest;
}
```

### `NotificationRequest`

An object representing a request to present a notification. It has content — how it's being represented — and a trigger — what triggers the notification. Many notifications ([`Notification`](#notification)) may be triggered with the same request (eg. a repeating notification).

```ts
export interface NotificationRequest {
  identifier: string;
  content: NotificationContent;
  trigger: NotificationTrigger;
}
```

### `NotificationContent`

An object representing notification's content.

```ts
export type NotificationContent = {
  // Notification title - the bold text displayed above the rest of the content
  title: string | null;
  // On iOS - subtitle - the bold text displayed between title and the rest of the content
  // On Android - subText - the display depends on the platform
  subtitle: string | null;
  // Notification body - the main content of the notification
  body: string | null;
  // Data associated with the notification, not displayed
  data: { [key: string]: unknown };
  // Application badge number associated with the notification
  badge: number | null;
  sound: 'default' | 'defaultCritical' | 'custom' | null;
} & (
  | {
      // iOS-specific additions
      // See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationcontent?language=objc
      // for more information on specific fields.
      launchImageName: string | null;
      attachments: {
        identifier: string | null;
        url: string | null;
        type: string | null;
      }[];
      summaryArgument?: string | null;
      summaryArgumentCount?: number;
      categoryIdentifier: string | null;
      threadIdentifier: string | null;
      targetContentIdentifier?: string;
    }
  | {
      // Android-specific additions
      // See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html#fields
      // for more information on specific fields.
      priority?: AndroidNotificationPriority;
      vibrationPattern?: number[];
      // Format: '#AARRGGBB'
      color?: string;
    }
);
```

### `NotificationContentInput`

An object representing notification content that you pass in to `presentNotificationAsync` or as a part of `NotificationRequestInput`.

```ts
export interface NotificationContentInput {
  // Fields corresponding to NotificationContent
  title?: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  body?: string;
  data?: { [key: string]: unknown };
  badge?: number;
  sound?: boolean | string;
  // Android-specific fields
  // See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.html#fields
  // for more information on specific fields.
  vibrate?: boolean | number[];
  priority?: AndroidNotificationPriority;
  // Format: '#AARRGGBB', '#RRGGBB' or one of the named colors,
  // see https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/graphics/Color?hl=en
  color?: string;
  // If set to false, the notification will not be automatically dismissed when clicked.
  // The setting used when the value is not provided or is invalid is true (the notification
  // will be dismissed automatically). Corresponds directly to Android's `setAutoCancel`
  // behavior. In Firebase terms this property of a notification is called `sticky`.
  // See:
  // - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder#setAutoCancel(boolean),
  // - https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/fcm/rest/v1/projects.messages#AndroidNotification.FIELDS.sticky
  autoDismiss?: boolean;
  // iOS-specific fields
  // See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unmutablenotificationcontent?language=objc
  // for more information on specific fields.
  launchImageName?: string;
  attachments?: {
    url: string;
    identifier?: string;

    typeHint?: string;
    hideThumbnail?: boolean;
    thumbnailClipArea?: { x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number };
    thumbnailTime?: number;
  }[];
}
```

### `NotificationRequestInput`

An object representing a notification request you can pass into `scheduleNotificationAsync`.

```ts
export interface NotificationRequestInput {
  identifier?: string;
  content: NotificationContentInput;
  trigger: NotificationTriggerInput;
}
```

### `AndroidNotificationPriority`

An enum corresponding to values appropriate for Android's [`Notification#priority`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#priority) field.

```ts
export enum AndroidNotificationPriority {
  MIN = 'min',
  LOW = 'low',
  DEFAULT = 'default',
  HIGH = 'high',
  MAX = 'max',
}
```

### `NotificationTrigger`

A union type containing different triggers which may cause the notification to be delivered to the application.

```ts
export type NotificationTrigger =
  | PushNotificationTrigger
  | CalendarNotificationTrigger
  | LocationNotificationTrigger
  | TimeIntervalNotificationTrigger
  | DailyNotificationTrigger
  | WeeklyNotificationTrigger
  | YearlyNotificationTrigger
  | UnknownNotificationTrigger;
```

### `PushNotificationTrigger`

An object representing a notification delivered by a push notification system.

On Android under `remoteMessage` field a JS version of the Firebase `RemoteMessage` may be accessed. On iOS under `payload` you may find full contents of [`UNNotificationContent`'s](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationcontent?language=objc) [`userInfo`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationcontent/1649869-userinfo?language=objc), i.e. [remote notification payload](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/CreatingtheNotificationPayload.html)

```ts
export type PushNotificationTrigger = { type: 'push' } & (
  | { payload: Record<string, unknown> } // iOS
  | { remoteMessage: FirebaseRemoteMessage } // Android
  | {}
);
```

## 🚀 Features

### Built-in splash screen image resize modes

`expo-splash-screen` contains a built-in feature for taking care of properly displaying your splash screen image. You can use the following resize modes to obtain behavior as if you were using the React Native `<Image>` component's `resizeMode` style.

#### `CONTAIN` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions the width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

<table>
  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr>
<td>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/379606/120575867-aeeb3580-c3d6-11eb-825d-19a847fe30f5.mp4

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### `COVER` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both the width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

<table>
  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr>

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### `NATIVE` resize mode

> **Android only.**

By using this resize mode your app will will leverage Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up.
Android (unlike iOS) does not support stretching of the provided image during launch, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen at its original dimensions.

<table>
  <thead><tr><td>Android</td></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr>
<td>

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> Animation above presents one of our [known issues](#native-mode-pushes-splash-image-up-a-little-bit)

Selecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.
Please take a look at the [`res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#resdrawablesplashscreenxml) and [`res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`](#resdrawablesplashscreen_backgroundpng) sections.

### Per-appearance (a.k.a. dark-mode) splash screen

`expo-splash-screen` supports per-appearance splash screens that respond to system appearance changes on iOS 13+ and dark-mode changes on Android 10+.

### StatusBar customization

`expo-splash-screen` allows customization of the StatusBar according to the [ReactNative StatusBar API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar).

## 📚 API

```tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
```

The native splash screen that is controlled via this module autohides once the ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. This means that when your app first `render`s view component, the native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync).

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`

This method makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync) is called. This must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in the global scope of your main component, or when the component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#-examples)).

Preventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first rendering some actual view hierarchy.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` when preventing autohiding succeeded and to `false` if the native splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (for instance, if you've already called this method).
`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden when this method was executed).

### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`

Hides the native splash screen. Only works if the native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) method.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` once the splash screen becomes hidden and to `false` if the splash screen is already hidden.

## 🗒 Examples

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope

`App.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()
  .then((result) => console.log(`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded: ${result}`))
  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to explicitly catch and inspect any error

export default class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Hides native splash screen after 2s
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }, 2000);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`

`App.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    appIsReady: false,
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding
    try {
      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(e);
    }
    this.prepareResources();
  }

  /**
   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls
   */
  prepareResources = async () => {
    await performAPICalls(...);
    await downloadAssets(...);

    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

## 💻 Installation in managed Expo projects

Refer to [the SplashScreen section of the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/).

## 🖥 Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

## Add the package to your dependencies

```
npx expo install expo-splash-screen
```

## 📱 Configure iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the package.

### Manual Configuration

To achieve native splash screen (in iOS ecosystem it's called `LaunchScreen`) behavior, you have to provide either a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file or a `SplashScreen.xib` file, and configure your Xcode project accordingly.

The guide below shows how to configure your Xcode project to use a single image file as a splash screen using a `.storyboard` file (configuration for `.xib` filetype is analogous).

1. [Add an image to `Images.xcassets`](#-add-an-image-to-imagesxcassets)
2. [Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-create-splashscreenstoryboard)
3. [Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-select-content-mode-for-the-imageview-in-splashscreenstoryboard)
4. [Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen](#-mark-splashscreenstoryboard-as-the-launchscreen)
5. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode)
6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar)

#### 🛠 Add an image to `Images.xcassets`

First you need to add the image file that would serve as a splash screen to your native project's resources.

1. In your Xcode project open the `.xcassets` (often named `Images.xcassets` or `Assets.xcassets`) file.
2. In the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreen`.
3. Provide the splash screen image you've prepared (you have to provide it in three different scales).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImagesXcassets.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### 🛠 Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`

This is the actual splash screen definition and will be used by the system to render your splash screen.

1. Create a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file.
2. Add a `View Controller` to the newly created `.storyboard` file:
   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
   - find `View Controller` element,
   - drag-and-drop it to the `.storyboard` file.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addViewControllerToStoryboard.png" height="350" />
</details>

3. Add an `Image View` to the `View Controller`:
   - first remove other `View` element from `View Controller`,
   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
   - find `Image View` element,
   - drag-and-drop it as a `View Controller` child in view hierarchy inspector.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImageViewToStoryboard.png" height="350" />
</details>

4. Set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`:
   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Identity Inspector` in the right panel,
   - and set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addStoryboardID.png" height="350" />
</details>

5. Tick `Is Initial View Controller` in `SplashScreenViewController`:
   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - and tick `Is Initial View Controller` in View Controller section.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-tickIsInitialViewController.png" height="350" />
</details>

6. Configure `Image View` source:
   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - select `SplashScreen` in `Image` parameter).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-configureImageView.png" height="350" />
</details>

7. Configure `Background` of the `Image View`:
   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - configure `Background` parameter:
     - To enter a `#RRGGBB` value you need to select `Custom` option and in the `Colors Popup` that appeared you need to navigate to the second tab and choose `RGB Sliders` from dropdown select.

 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectBackgroundColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### 🛠 Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`

This is how your image will be displayed on the screen.

1. Open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` from `View Controller`.
2. Navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and locate `Content Mode`.
3. Select one of the following:
   - `Aspect Fit` to obtain [CONTAIN resize mode](#contain-resize-mode),
   - `Aspect Fill` to obtain [COVER resize mode](#cover-resize-mode).
4. You can always choose other options to achieve different image positioning and scaling.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectImageViewContentMode.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### 🛠 Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen

The newly created `SplashScreen.storyboard` needs to be marked as the `Launch Screen File` in your Xcode project in order to be presented from the very beginning of your application launch.

1. Select your project in `Project Navigator`
2. Select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `General` tab.
3. Locate `App Icons and Launch Images` section and `Launch Screen File` option.
4. Select or enter `SplashScreen` as the value for located option.

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode

##### Provide different background colors

Depending on what iOS version your application is targeting, you have to adjust your native project differently to a obtain working per-appearance splash screen view.

##### I'm targeting iOS 11+

You can take advantage of [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) in your Xcode project.

1. Create a new `Color Set` and customize its values for different color modes:
   - in your `.xcassets` directory (either create a new `.xcassets` for colors, or reuse an existing one e.g. with images) create `New Color Set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and change `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,
   - select desired color in `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel for each mode.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-createNamedColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

2. Select created `named color` as the `Background` for the `Image View` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`:
   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - configure `Background` parameter by selecting your created `named color` (that should be listed as `SplashScreenBackground`).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectNamedColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

##### I'm targeting iOS version < 11

You cannot use [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) feature in your Xcode project.
Instead you have to create an additional image set that contains small 1x1px images, each with the desired background color. Then, you'll use this additional image resource as a background in the splash screen view.

You can use this online generator to obtain 1x1px `.png` images with desired colors: http://www.1x1px.me.

1. Create `SplashScreenBackground` `Image Set` with desired background colors for each mode in your `Images.xcassets` directory:
   - open your `.xcassets` directory with images,
   - in the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,
   - convert this `Image set` to support `Dark Appearance` by navigating to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and changing `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,
   - provide images with colors for every mode (you can generate color 1x1px images using http://www.1x1px.me).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addSplashScreenBackgroundImages.png" height="250" />
</details>

2. Update `SplashScreen.storyboard` to consist of a single top-level `View` with two `Image View` subviews (solid-colored image in the background and actual splash screen image in the foreground):

   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and replace `Image View` with a plain `View` (search `Library` for it and drag&drop it in place of current `Image View`),
   - add two

3. Configure first `Image View` (background color):
   - configure attributes in `Attributes Inspector`:
     - set `Image` to `SplashScreenBackground` (prepared in previous step),
     - set `Content Mode` to `Scale To Fill` (color needs to take all available space),
   - make this subview take all available space in parent view:
     - open `Add new constraints` bottom menu,
     - make sure `Constrain to margin` is not checked,
     - for every input, open the dropdown and select `View` (parent view reference) and set `0` as the value,
     - once every side is covered (`0` value and parent view reference selected in dropdown) hit `Add 4 Constraints`,
     - observe that in `View Hierarchy Inspector` constraints are added and `Image View` resized to take whole place of parent view.

</details>

4. Configure second `Image View` (actual splash screen image):
   - select second `Image View` and select correct `Image` in `Attributes Inspector` alongside with desired `Content Mode`,
   - make this subview take all available space in parent view (see previous step).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addConstraintsToImageViews.png" height="350" />
</details>

##### Provide different splash screen image

You might want to add a separate image for `dark` mode. If the system is switched to `dark` mode, it would pick this different image instead of the normal one and present it in the splash screen view.

1. In your Xcode project open `SplashScreen` (created in previous section).
2. Convert this asset to support `Dark Appearance`:

- navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
- locate `Appearances` section and select `Any, Dark`,
- provide image for `dark mode` by dropping it to the correct box.

</details>

###### Background color when you want to support iOS < 11

If you're targeting a version of iOS < 11 then you cannot use `named color` feature and instead you need to generate images with desired background colors that are going to be used as the background for splash screen view.
There is this awesome 1x1px png online generator: http://www.1x1px.me (use it to generate two 1x1px images with desired background colors for different color modes).

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar

You might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.

1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag:

- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,
- add or modify `Status bar initially hidden` attribute with desired value.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-hidden.png" height="350" />
</details>

2. Customize `StatusBar style` option:

- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,
- add or modify `Status bar style` attribute with desired value.

## 🤖 Configure Android

To achieve fully-native splash screen behavior, `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into the native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to be placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.

### Manual Configuration

1. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreen_imagepng)
2. [Configure `res/values/colors.xml`](#-configure-resvaluescolorsxml)
3. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreenxml)
4. [Configure `res/values/styles.xml`](#-configure-resvaluesstylesxml)
5. [Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`](#-configure-androidmanifestxml)
6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customzine `resizeMode`](#-optional-customize-resizemode)
7. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode-1)
8. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar-1)

#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`

You have to provide your splash screen image and place it under the `res/drawable` directory.
This image will be loaded as soon as Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.

##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've overridden `<string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you need to do a few additional steps.

In your application's `res` directory you might want to have a number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). They store different versions of images that are picked based on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).

To achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:

- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)
- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).
- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).

Each of directories mentioned above should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with a different resolution (pay attention to scale factors).

#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/colors.xml`

This file contains colors that are reused across your application at the native level.
Update the file with the following content or create one if missing:

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->
</resources>
```

#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`

This file contains the description of how the splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.
Create the file with the following content:

```diff
+ <layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
+   <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ </layer-list>
```

#### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've overridden `<string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you shoulw add:

```diff
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ <item>
+   <bitmap android:gravity="center" android:src="@drawable/splashscreen_image"/>
+ </item>
</layer-list>
```

#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/styles.xml`

Locate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.

```diff
  <!-- Main activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
+   <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

#### 🛠 Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`

Adjust your application's main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain an `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains your splash screen configuration:

```diff
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

  ...

  <application ...>

+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->
    <activity
      android:name=".MainActivity"
+     android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
      ...
    >
      ...
    </activity>
  </application>

</manifest>
```

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize `resizeMode`

The default image [`resizeMode`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#built-in-splash-screen-image-resize-modes) is [`CONTAIN`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#contain-resize-mode). If you want to have different `resizeMode`, you need to override in `res/values/strings.xml`.

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">contain|cover|native</string>
</resources>
```

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode

##### Provide different background colors - `res/values-night/colors.png`

If you want to have different background colors in your splash screen depending on the system color mode, you need to create a similar file to `colors.xml`, but in the directory `res/values-night`.
Values in this file are going to picked by the system when it is switched to `dark` mode.

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
</resources>
```

##### Provide different splash screen image - `res/drawable-night/splashscreen_image.png`

You might want to provide a separate splash screen image for dark mode usage, and place it under the `res/drawable-night` directory with exactly the same name as the normal one.
This step is optional, because you might want to have the same image in both `light` and `dark` modes (e.g. you have just a light-themed logo and you want to have different background colors in different modes).

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar

You might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.

1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag

To have the StatusBar completely hidden you need to update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry (to prevent StatusBar from hiding either remove this entry or enter `false` as the value):

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:windowFullscreen">true</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:windowFullscreen` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowFullscreen).

2. Customize `StatusBar style` option

This option is only available for Android devices running Android 6.0 or greater.
To enforce `light` or `dark` StatusBar style for given system color mode, you have to prepare or update your `res/values-v23/styles.xml` file with the following entry (as of this option being supported since API 23, you have to configure specifically named directory containing separate configuration files):

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:windowLightStatusBar">true|false</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

Available values:

- `true` for having dark-colored icons,
- `false` for having light-colored icons.

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night-v23` (for dark color mode), etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:windowLightStatusBar` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowLightStatusBar).

To read more about Android multi-API-level support see [this official documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).

3. Customize `StatusBar color` option (a.k.a. `background color` of the StatusBar component)

To achieve custom background color you need to create a new color resource and provide it to the SplashScreen `style` description.

Create new color resource in your `res/values/colors.xml` (if your application supports dark mode, consider adding different color in `res/values-night/colors.xml` file):

```diff
  <resources>
    <color name="splashscreen_background">#D0D0C0</color>
+   <color name="splashscreen_statusbar_color">#(AA)RRGGBB</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  </resources>
```

Update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry:

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:statusBarColor">@color/splashscreen_statusbar_color</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:statusBarColor` option in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#statusBarColor).

4. Customize `StatusBar translucent` flag

When the StatusBar is translucent, the app will be able to draw under the StatusBar component area.

To make the StatusBar translucent update your `res/values/strings.xml` file with the following content:

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent">true</string>
</resources>
```

## ❓ Known issues

### iOS caching

Splash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However, the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.

### `NATIVE` mode pushes splash image up a little bit

See [`NATIVE`](#native-resize-mode) mode preview above.

> We are aware of this issue and unfortunately haven't been able to provide a solution as of yet. This is on our immediate roadmap...

## ⬆️ Migrate from old versions

### Migrate from expo-splash-screen < 0.12.0

We try to keep changes backward compatible, the code for `expo-splash-screen` will still work as it used to be. However, if you are going to migrate as new style API, here are the steps:

1. Migrate your project from react-native-unimodules to expo-modules-core
2. Remove expo-splash-screen code from MainActivity

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java
+++ b/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java
 import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;
 import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;

-import expo.modules.splashscreen.singletons.SplashScreen;
-import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;
-
 public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     // This is required for expo-splash-screen.
     setTheme(R.style.AppTheme);
     super.onCreate(null);
-    // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)
-    SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class, false);
   }
```

3. Override default `resizeMode` and `statusBarTranslucent` in stings.xml

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">contain</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent">false</string>
</resources>
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - fb-watchman@2.0.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# fb-watchman

`fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from
Facebook.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very
efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and
filesystem tree querying operations using
[a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).

## Install

You should [install Watchman](
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this
module.

Then simply:

```
$ npm install fb-watchman
```

## Key Concepts

- Watchman recursively watches directories.
- Each watched directory is called a `root`.
- You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes
- Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root)
- change notifications are relative to the project root

## How do I use it?

[Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)

### 2. Installation

```sh

```

#### 2.1 Packages

`FFmpeg` includes built-in encoders for some popular formats. However, there are certain external libraries that needs
to be enabled in order to encode specific formats/codecs. For example, to encode an `mp3` file you need `lame` or
`shine` library enabled. You have to install a `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` package that has at least one of them inside.
To encode an `h264` video, you need to install a package with `x264` inside. To encode `vp8` or `vp9` videos, you need
a `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` package with `libvpx` inside.

`ffmpeg-kit` provides eight packages that include different sets of external libraries. These packages are named
according to the external libraries included. Refer to the
[Packages](https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit/wiki/Packages) wiki page to see the names of those
packages and external libraries included in each one of them.

(*) - Main `https` package is the default package

#### 2.2 Enabling Packages

Installing `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` enables the `https` package by default. It is possible to enable other
packages using the instructions below.

##### 2.2.1 Enabling a Package on Android

- Edit `android/build.gradle` file and add the package name in `ext.ffmpegKitPackage` variable.

    ```gradle
    ext {
        ffmpegKitPackage = "<package name>"
    }

    ```

##### 2.2.2 Enabling a Package on iOS

- Edit `ios/Podfile` file and add the package name as `subspec`. After that run `pod install` again.

    ```ruby
    pod 'ffmpeg-kit-react-native', :subspecs => ['<package name>'], :podspec => '../node_modules/ffmpeg-kit-react-native/ffmpeg-kit-react-native.podspec'
    ```

- Note that if you have `use_native_modules!` in your `Podfile`, specifying a `subspec` may cause the following error.
  You can fix it by defining `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` dependency before `use_native_modules!` in your `Podfile`.

  ```
  [!] There are multiple dependencies with different sources for `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` in `Podfile`:

  - ffmpeg-kit-react-native (from `../node_modules/ffmpeg-kit-react-native`)
  - ffmpeg-kit-react-native/video (from `../node_modules/ffmpeg-kit-react-native/ffmpeg-kit-react-native.podspec`)
  ```

#### 2.3 Enabling LTS Releases

In order to install the `LTS` variant, install the `https-lts` package using instructions in `2.2` or append `-lts` to
the package name you are using.

#### 2.4 LTS Releases

`ffmpeg-kit-react-native` is published in two variants: `Main Release` and `LTS Release`. Both releases share the
same source code but is built with different settings (Architectures, API Level, iOS Min SDK, etc.). Refer to the
[LTS Releases](https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit/wiki/LTS-Releases) wiki page to see how they differ from each
other.

### 3. Using

1. Execute FFmpeg commands.

    ```js
    import { FFmpegKit } from 'ffmpeg-kit-react-native';

    FFmpegKit.execute('-i file1.mp4 -c:v mpeg4 file2.mp4').then(async (session) => {
      const returnCode = await session.getReturnCode();

      if (ReturnCode.isSuccess(returnCode)) {

        // SUCCESS

      } else if (ReturnCode.isCancel(returnCode)) {

        // CANCEL

      } else {

        // ERROR

      }
    });
    ```

2. Each `execute` call creates a new session. Access every detail about your execution from the
   session created.

    ```js
    FFmpegKit.execute('-i file1.mp4 -c:v mpeg4 file2.mp4').then(async (session) => {

      // Unique session id created for this execution
      const sessionId = session.getSessionId();

      // Command arguments as a single string
      const command = session.getCommand();

      // Command arguments
      const commandArguments = session.getArguments();

      // State of the execution. Shows whether it is still running or completed
      const state = await session.getState();

      // Return code for completed sessions. Will be undefined if session is still running or FFmpegKit fails to run it
      const returnCode = await session.getReturnCode()

      const startTime = session.getStartTime();
      const endTime = await session.getEndTime();
      const duration = await session.getDuration();

      // Console output generated for this execution
      const output = await session.getOutput();

      // The stack trace if FFmpegKit fails to run a command
      const failStackTrace = await session.getFailStackTrace()

      // The list of logs generated for this execution
      const logs = await session.getLogs();

      // The list of statistics generated for this execution (only available on FFmpegSession)
      const statistics = await session.getStatistics();

    });
    ```

3. Execute `FFmpeg` commands by providing session specific `execute`/`log`/`session` callbacks.

    ```js
    FFmpegKit.executeAsync('-i file1.mp4 -c:v mpeg4 file2.mp4', session => {

      // CALLED WHEN SESSION IS EXECUTED

    }, log => {

      // CALLED WHEN SESSION PRINTS LOGS

    }, statistics => {

      // CALLED WHEN SESSION GENERATES STATISTICS

    });
    ```

4. Execute `FFprobe` commands.

    ```js
    FFprobeKit.execute(ffprobeCommand).then(async (session) => {

      // CALLED WHEN SESSION IS EXECUTED

    });
    ```

5. Get media information for a file/url.

    ```js
    FFprobeKit.getMediaInformation(testUrl).then(async (session) => {
      const information = await session.getMediaInformation();

      if (information === undefined) {

        // CHECK THE FOLLOWING ATTRIBUTES ON ERROR
        const state = FFmpegKitConfig.sessionStateToString(await session.getState());
        const returnCode = await session.getReturnCode();
        const failStackTrace = await session.getFailStackTrace();
        const duration = await session.getDuration();
        const output = await session.getOutput();
      }
    });
    ```

6. Stop ongoing FFmpeg operations.

  - Stop all sessions
    ```js
    FFmpegKit.cancel();
    ```
  - Stop a specific session
    ```js
    FFmpegKit.cancel(sessionId);
    ```

7. (Android) Convert Storage Access Framework (SAF) Uris into paths that can be read or written by
`FFmpegKit` and `FFprobeKit`.

  - Reading a file:
    ```js
    FFmpegKitConfig.selectDocumentForRead('*/*').then(uri => {
        FFmpegKitConfig.getSafParameterForRead(uri).then(safUrl => {
            FFmpegKit.executeAsync(`-i ${safUrl} -c:v mpeg4 file2.mp4`);
        });
    });
    ```

  - Writing to a file:
    ```js
    FFmpegKitConfig.selectDocumentForWrite('video.mp4', 'video/*').then(uri => {
        FFmpegKitConfig.getSafParameterForWrite(uri).then(safUrl => {
            FFmpegKit.executeAsync(`-i file1.mp4 -c:v mpeg4 ${safUrl}`);
        });
    });
    ```

8. Get previous `FFmpeg`, `FFprobe` and `MediaInformation` sessions from the session history.

    ```js
    FFmpegKit.listSessions().then(sessionList => {
      sessionList.forEach(async session => {
        const sessionId = session.getSessionId();
      });
    });

    FFprobeKit.listFFprobeSessions().then(sessionList => {
      sessionList.forEach(async session => {
        const sessionId = session.getSessionId();
      });
    });

    FFprobeKit.listMediaInformationSessions().then(sessionList => {
      sessionList.forEach(async session => {
        const sessionId = session.getSessionId();
      });
    });
    ```

9. Enable global callbacks.
  - Session type specific Complete Callbacks, called when an async session has been completed

    ```js
    FFmpegKitConfig.enableFFmpegSessionCompleteCallback(session => {
      const sessionId = session.getSessionId();
    });

    FFmpegKitConfig.enableFFprobeSessionCompleteCallback(session => {
      const sessionId = session.getSessionId();
    });

    FFmpegKitConfig.enableMediaInformationSessionCompleteCallback(session => {
      const sessionId = session.getSessionId();
    });
    ```

  - Log Callback, called when a session generates logs

    ```js
    FFmpegKitConfig.enableLogCallback(log => {
      const message = log.getMessage();
    });
    ```

  - Statistics Callback, called when a session generates statistics

    ```js
    FFmpegKitConfig.enableStatisticsCallback(statistics => {
      const size = statistics.getSize();
    });
    ```

10. Register system fonts and custom font directories.

    ```js
    FFmpegKitConfig.setFontDirectoryList(["/system/fonts", "/System/Library/Fonts", "<folder with fonts>"]);
    ```

### 4. Test Application

You can see how `FFmpegKit` is used inside an application by running `react-native` test applications developed under
the [FFmpegKit Test](https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit-test) project.

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following npm packages may be included in this product:

 - flow-parser@0.206.0
 - flow-parser@0.226.0

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

# The flow-parser package

This package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.

# What is Flow

See [flow.org](https://flow.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).

# What is the Flow Parser

The Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.

# Usage

You can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do

```JavaScript
require('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});
```

To use in the browser, you can add

```HTML
<script src="flow_parser.js"></script>
```

which will make the `flow` object available to use like so:

```JavaScript
flow.parse('1+1', {});
```

## Options

The second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:

* `all_comments` (boolean, default `true`) - include a list of all comments from the whole program
* `comments` (boolean, default `true`) - attach comments to AST nodes (`leadingComments` and `trailingComments`)
* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums
* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators
* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax
* `tokens` (boolean, default `false`) - include a list of all parsed tokens in a top-level `tokens` property
* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types
* `use_strict` (boolean, default `false`) - treat the file as strict, without needing a "use strict" directive

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - https-proxy-agent@5.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

https-proxy-agent
================
### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)

This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.

Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
See the "Examples" section below for more.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install https-proxy-agent
```


Examples
--------

#### `https` module example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var https = require('https');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
var options = url.parse(endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
options.agent = agent;

https.get(options, function (res) {
  console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
  res.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

#### `ws` WebSocket connection example

``` js
var url = require('url');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);

// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);

// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
var options = url.parse(proxy);

var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);

// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });

socket.on('open', function () {
  console.log('"open" event!');
  socket.send('hello world');
});

socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
  console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
  socket.close();
});
```

API
---

### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)

The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].

The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
"options" object with more specific properties:

  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.
  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its

2.2. Effective Date

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

* 6. Disclaimer of Warranty *
* ------------------------- *
* *
* Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" *
* basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or *
* statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the *
* Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a *
* particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the *
* quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. *
* Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You *
* (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, *
* repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an *
* essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is *
* authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. *
* *
************************************************************************

************************************************************************
* *
* 7. Limitation of Liability *
* -------------------------- *
* *
* Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort *
* (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any *
* Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as *
* permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, *
* special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character *
* including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of *
* goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any *
* and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party *
* shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This *
* limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or *
* personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the *
* extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some *
* jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of *
* incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and *
* limitation may not apply to You. *
* *
************************************************************************

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

Originally a fork of [`jest-haste-map`](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/main/packages/jest-haste-map).

This entire package should be considered "experimental" for the time being -
the API is considered internal and changes will not be semver-breaking.

[raise an issue](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/new) to discuss your
use case.

-----------

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - metro-react-native-babel-preset@0.76.8

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# metro-react-native-babel-preset

Babel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.

If you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.

## Usage

As mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.

### Installation

Install `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:

with `npm`:

```sh
npm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev
```

or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add -D metro-react-native-babel-preset
```

### Configuring Babel

Then, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:

```
{
  "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"]
}
```

You can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.

## Help and Support

If you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.

 - node-forge@1.3.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Apache License
                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - react-devtools-core@4.28.5

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `react-devtools-core`

This package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.

This package provides two entrypoints: labeled "backend" and "standalone" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.

# Backend API

Backend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.

### Example

If you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const { connectToDevTools } = require("react-devtools-core");

  // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported
  connectToDevTools({
    ...config
  });
}
```

> **NOTE** that this API (`connectToDevTools`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`).

### `connectToDevTools` options
| Prop | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. |
| `isAppActive` |  | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it's ready to connect to React. |
| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. |
| `resolveRNStyle` |  | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. |
| `retryConnectionDelay` | `200` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection |
| `useHttps` | `false` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). |
| `websocket` |  | Custom `WebSocket` connection to frontend; overrides `host` and `port` settings. |

# Frontend API

Frontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.

### Example
```js
import DevtoolsUI from "react-devtools-core/standalone";

// See the full list of API methods in documentation below.
const { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;

// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element.
setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById("container"));

// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend.
startServer(
  // Port defaults to 8097
  1234,

  // Host defaults to "localhost"
  "example.devserver.com",

  // Optional config for secure socket (WSS).
  {
    key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')
  }
);
```

### Exported methods
The `default` export is an object defining the methods described below.

These methods support chaining for convenience. For example:
```js
const DevtoolsUI = require("react-devtools-core/standalone");
DevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer();
```

#### `connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)`
> This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.

Custom `WebSocket` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling `startServer()`).

#### `openProfiler()`
Automatically select the "Profiler" tab in the DevTools UI.

#### `setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)`
Set the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.

#### `setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)`
_Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools `WebSocket` closes (or errors).

#### `setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)`
_Optional_ set of root directories for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component's source code using an IDE.

#### `setStatusListener(callback: Function)`
_Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).

This callback receives two parameters:
```js
function onStatus(
  message: string,
  status: 'server-connected' | 'devtools-connected' | 'error'
): void {
  // ...
}
```

#### `startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)`
Start a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.

This method accepts the following parameters:
| Name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. |
| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. |
| `httpsOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining `key` and `cert` strings. |
| `loggerOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining a `surface` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |

# Development

Watch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:backend
```

Watch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:standalone
```

Run the standalone UI using `yarn start` in the [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - readline@1.3.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## _readline_
> Read a file line by line.

## Install

## Important. In node 10 there is a core module named readline. Please use linebyline instead, it is the same module just renamed:
[Npm linebyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linebyline)

```sh
npm install linebyline
```

## Test
```sh
npm install .
npm test

```


## What's this?

Simple streaming readline module for NodeJS. Reads a file and buffers new lines emitting a _line_ event for each line.

## Usage
### Simple
```js
  var readline = require('linebyline'),
      rl = readline('./somefile.txt');
  rl.on('line', function(line, lineCount, byteCount) {
    // do something with the line of text
  })
  .on('error', function(e) {
    // something went wrong
  });
```

### ASCII file decoding
As the underlying `fs.createReadStream` doesn't care about the specific ASCII encoding of the file, an alternative way to decode the file is by telling the `readline` library to retain buffer and then decoding it using a converter (e.g. [`iconv-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite)).
```js
  var readline = require('linebyline'),
      rl = readline('./file-in-win1251.txt', {
    retainBuffer: true //tell readline to retain buffer 
  });
  rl.on("line", function (data,linecount){
    var line = iconv.decode(data, 'win1251');
    // do something with the line of converted text
  });
```
##API
## readLine(readingObject[, options])
### Params:

* `readingObject` - file path or stream object
* `options` can include:
  * `maxLineLength` - override the default 4K buffer size (lines longer than this will not be read)
  * `retainBuffer` - avoid converting to String prior to emitting 'line' event; will pass raw buffer with encoded data to the callback

### Return:

* **EventEmitter**

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - safe-json-stringify@1.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Safe JSON Stringify
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify)
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/safe-json-stringify.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-json-stringify)

A wrapper for `JSON.stringify` that handles circular references and prevents defined getters from throwing errors.

Circular references are handled by returning `[Circular]` when a circular reference is spotted.

Defined getters that throw errors are handled by returning `[Throws]`.

Usage
-----
Install it using NPM

```sh
npm install safe-json-stringify
```

And require it into your Node project.

```js
const safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');
const data = {foo: 'bar'}

console.log(safeJsonStringify(data));
```

All the parameters of `JSON.stringify` are accepted, try e.g. the following for a nicely formatted output:

```js
console.log(safeJsonStringify(data, null, 2));
```

An `ensureProperties` function is exposed too, which returns a safe object without the stringify step. Usage: `safeJsonStringify.ensureProperties(data);`.


Why?
----
The `stringify` function on the JavaScript JSON object will take any data and return a string representation of said data. If this data contains an object literal it will attempt to return the values of any enumerable property set on this object. This can be dangerous because JavaScript supports a couple of ways to define property getters on objects.

The old, non-standard, and now deprecated `Object.prototype.__defineGetter__()` will define a named property which value is the return of a given function.

```js
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
obj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { return 'bar'; });

JSON.stringify(obj); // {"foo":"bar"}
```

This is kinda bad because we could make that function throw an error.

```js
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
obj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); });

JSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown
```

This property is created as an enumerable on the object, so the object from the previous example would make any function that iterates choke and throw an error. This is bad because one would never expect a simple property get to throw an error and bring down a system.

`JSON.stringify` will blindly trust any object property, and will throw an error if it hits a defined property that throws an error. This could potentially take down your program.

The slightly better `Object.defineProperty()` does the same thing, but has the common courtesy to not define the getter as enumerable--that is per default. The following example would bring us in the same situation as with `__defineGetter__`.

```js
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {
    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },
        enumerable: true // enumerable is false by default
});

JSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown
```

So, we can not trust any of them. One could argue that they should never be used, and we can, and should, apply that principle to our own software, but we cannot trust code from third-party modules. If data from third-party modules are to be stringified by JSON we should take these situations into considerations. This module attempt to do that by spotting defined getters and return "[Throws]" if said getter throws an error.

```js
var safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {
    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },
        enumerable: true
});

safeJsonStringify(obj); // '{"foo":"[Throws]"}'
```

And it attempts to handle circular references too. It returns "[Circular]" if it spots one.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Node Stream Buffers

[![Build Status][badge-travis-img]][badge-travis-url]
[![Code Climate][badge-climate-img]][badge-climate-url]
[![Code Coverage][badge-coverage-img]][badge-coverage-url]

Simple Readable and Writable Streams that use a [Buffer][node-buffer-docs] to store received data, or for data to send out. Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.

## Installation

[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]

## Usage

To use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.

```js
var streamBuffers = require("stream-buffers");
```

### Writable StreamBuffer

Writable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.

```js
var myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({
	initialSize: (100 * 1024),		// start as 100 kilobytes.
	incrementAmount: (10 * 1024)	// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.
});
```

The default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:

```js
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE 		// (8 * 1024)
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT	// (8 * 1024)
```

Writing is standard Stream stuff:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);
// - or -
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("\u00bd + \u00bc = \u00be", "utf8");
```

You can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: 

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF");
streamBuffers.size();			// 4.
streamBuffers.maxSize();		// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).
```

Retrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();					// Gets all held data as a Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8");		// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);					// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8", 5);	// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.
```

Care should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).
 
Destroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF");
myWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();

myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();		// Returns ASDF in Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("Yeah?");		// No effect.
```	

### Readable StreamBuffer

Readable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. 

The frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.

```js
var myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({
	frequency: 10,		// in milliseconds.
	chunkSize: 2048		// in bytes.
});
```

Default frequency and chunk size:

```js
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE 		// (1024)
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY			// (1)
```

Putting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);
myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String", "utf8");
```

Chunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: 

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) {
	// Yup.
	assert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);
});
```

Chunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. 

setEncoding() for streams is respected too:

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding("utf8");
myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) {
	assert.isTrue(data instanceof String);
});
```

Pause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. 

Destroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. 

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();
myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String!");
myReadableStreamBuffer.size();			// will be 0.
```

## Disclaimer

Not supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - structured-headers@0.4.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

Structured Headers parser for Javascript
========================================

This library is a parser and serializer for the [Structured Headers][1]
specification, a.k.a. "Structured Field Values for HTTP" (RFC8941).

This specification defines a standard serialization for complex HTTP header
values, including lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps) and also numbers,
booleans, and binary data.

The library is written in Typescript, and the examples in this document are
too, but plain Javascript is also fully supported.

Compatibility
-------------

This package has 2725 unittests, the vast majority are supplied from the
official [HTTP WG test suite][2].

However, there are 2 differences in the serializer:

1. Javascript can't differentiate between `1.0` and `1`. As a result we're
   skipping the tests that require a serialiation output of `1.0`.
2. Javascript rounds slightly different from the spec. The tests suggest that
   `0.0025` should round to the nearest event number (`0.002`), but Javascript
   rounds to `0.003`.

No fix is planned for #1, because there's no reasonably way to fix this
without wrapping every number in a custom class, and this will negatively
impact the developer experience. We do intend to fix #2 in the future with a
custom rounding algorithm.

This library emits and expects the _exact_ data structures as they are
suggested by the RFC. The result of this is that the returned types can be
a bit complex.

In the future we intend to loosen the required types for the serializer, and
add new helper functions that give you simpler structures _if_ you don't need
certain features for a header (such as `Parameters`).

Let us know what you would like to see here!

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install structured-headers
```

API
---

### Parsing an item

The following are examples of `item` headers:

Parsed as string

```
# Parsed as string
Header: "foo"

# A simple string, called a 'Token' in the spec
Header: foo

# Parsed as number
Header: 5
Header: -10
Header: 5.01415

# Parsed into boolean
Header: ?1
Header: ?0

# Binaries are base64 encoded
Header: :RE0gbWUgZm9yIGEgZnJlZSBjb29raWU=:

# Items can have parameters
Header: "Hello world"; a="5"
```


To parse these header values, use the `parseItem`:

```typescript
import { parseItem } from 'structured-headers';

console.log(
  parseItem(header)
);
```

parseItem returns a tuple (array with 2 items), the first item is the value,
the second is a `Map` object with parameters.

The type is roughly:

```typescript

// The raw value
type BareItem = number | string | Token | ByteSequence | boolean;

// The return type of parseItem
type Item = [
  BareItem,
  Map<string, BareItem>
];
```

### Parsing a list

A list is an array of items. Some examples:

```
# A simple list
Header: 5, "foo", bar, ?1

# Each element can have parameters
Header: sometoken; param1; param2=hi, 42

# A list can also contain lists itself. These are called 'inner lists' and
# use parenthesis
Header: sometoken, (innerlistitem1 innerlistitem2), (anotherlist)
```


To parse these:

```typescript
import { parseList } from 'structured-headers';

console.log(
  parseList(header)
);
```

`parseList` returns an array with each member. The return type is:

```typescript
type InnerList = [Item[], Parameters];
type List = (InnerList|Item)[];
```

### Parsing a dictionary

A dictionary is a key->value object. Examples:

```
# A simple dictionary
Header: fn="evert", ln="pot", coffee=?1

# Each item may have parameters too
Header: foo=123; q=1, bar=123, q=0.5

# A dictionary value may be an inner list again
Header: foo=(1 2 3)
```

To parse dictionaries:

```typescript
import { parseDictionary } from 'structured-headers';

console.log(
  parseDictionary(header)
);
```

The return type for `parseDictionary` is a `Map`.

```typescript
type Dictionary = Map<string, Item|InnerList>;
```


### Serializing

The serialiser functions work the exact same way, but in opposite direction.
They all return strings.

Currently the serializes expect the *exact type* that the parsers return, but
the intention is to loosen the types for serialization, so it's a bit more
ergnomic to call. Want this? Let me know by opening an issue.


```javascript
import {
  serializeDictionary,
  serializeList,
  serializeItem
} from 'structured-headers';


// Returns "foo", "bar"
serializeList([
  ['foo', new Map()],
  ['bar', new Map()],
]);

// Returns a=1, b=?0
sh.serializeDictionary(new Map([
  ['a', [1, new Map()]],
  ['b', [false, new Map()]],
]));

// Returns 42
serializeItem([42, new Map()]);

// Returns 5.5
serializeItem([5.5, new Map()]);

// Returns "hello world"
serializeItem(["hello world", new Map()]);

// Returns ?1
serializeItem([true, new Map()]);

// Returns a base-64 representation like: *aGVsbG8=*
serializeItem([new ByteSequence('aGVsbG8='), new Map()]);
```

Browser support
---------------

There is a minified version of this library in the `browser/` directory. This minified
file will expose a global variable called 'structuredHeader' which contains the rest
of the api.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - use-latest-callback@0.1.9

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# use-latest-callback

React hook which returns the latest callback without changing the reference.

This is useful for scenarios such as event listeners where you may not want to resubscribe when the callback changes.

## Installation

Open a Terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
npm install use-latest-callback
```

## Usage

The `useLatestCallback` hook accepts a function as its argument and returns a function that preserves its reference across renders.

```js
const useLatestCallback = require('use-latest-callback');

// ...

function MyComponent() {
  const callback = useLatestCallback((value) => {
    console.log('Changed', value);
  });

  React.useEffect(() => {
    someEvent.addListener(callback);

    return () => someEvent.removeListener(callback);
  }, [callback]);

  return <>{/* whatever */}</>;
}
```

It's important to note that the callback is not intended to be called during the render phase. Only call the callback in response to an event.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - wnpm-ci@8.0.131

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# wnpm-ci

# What is this module
This module contains all you need to have the ci build an npm package in the CI servers.

This module exports a bin (`wnpm-release`) that knows how to build and release a module the wix standard way.
It also exports functions that can help write an alternative release logic if somebody wants to.

# How to create an NPM module that works in CI
* Create a package with the following mandatory things in the package.json
  * `name`
  * `version`
  * One of two:
    * `publishConfig.registry` pointing to `http://npm.dev.wixpress.com/` or...
    * `publishConfig.registry` pointing to `https://registry.npmjs.org/` if you want to publish it to the public repository (for an open source npm module), or...
    * `private: true` if you don't want to publish the module
* Run `npm install --save-dev wnpm-ci` to install this package
* Ensure that you have a "build" script in your package.json. If you have nothing to do in this step, make it `":"`
* Ensure that you have a "test" script in your package.json. If you have nothing to do in this step, make it `":"`
* Ensure that you have a "release" script in your package.json, and make
this `"wnpm-release"` (the wnpm-release will be coming from this package, which you installed earlier)
* For non protobuf modules: Add a pom.xml, because currently CI does not work without a pom.xml. (For protobuf modules, it's enough to only have `package.json`. Having both `package.json` and `pom.xml` will break!)  
This requirement will be removed in the near future. See below for a minimal pom.xml
* If your package is using dependencies from the Wix NPM repo, it should contain an `.npmrc` file at its root directory with the line `registry=http://npm.dev.wixpress.com/`.

## A minimal package.json with all the above
```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "http://npm.dev.wixpress.com/"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": ":",
    "test": ":",
    "release": "wnpm-release # This will ensure that ci publishes the module"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "wnpm-ci": "*"
  }
}
```

## A more typical package.json with all the above
```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "http://npm.dev.wixpress.com/"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel src --out-dir lib",
    "test": "mocha",
    "release": "wnpm-release # This will ensure that ci publishes the module"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@wix/wnpm-ci": "*"
  }
}
```

## A minimal pom.xml for an npm module
Replace the text between the *****
```xml

# How does CI build and release an NPM module?
* CI will look for a file named `build.js` in the root of the module. If it exists, it will `node build.js`-it.
* If not, it will use its own `build.js` which does the following:
  * `npm install` - no need to do anything
  * `npm run build`
  * `npm test`
  * If package is not private (https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#private): `npm run release`
* Once done, it will publish the package, assuming it is not private

## What does `wnpm-release` do?
* Nothing if the package is private. Leave it there still for future use.
* Increments the version in package.json so that publishing will succeed
  (see below to understand the algorithm of version incrementing)
  * Note that since CI is running `wnpm-release` during the build, the version change in `package.json` will not be committed to git
* If you prefer to bump the minor version instead of patch, you can also do `wnpm-release --bump-minor`
* Note that `wnpm-release` no longer creates a shrinkwrap. If you want a shrinkwrap simply use `wnpm-release && npm shrinkwrap` in your release script

## How `wnpm-release` increments the version
* TL;DR - it increments by one the patch version of the latest patch version in the npm registry
* It increments only the patch version (i.e. the '5' in 3.4.5)
* It reads the registry to retrieve the published versions of this package.
* It ignores all versions who's major.minor versions are not the same as the major.minor version in the package.
* It takes the latest patch number of the biggest versions in the list of unignored version from previous bullet
* If the version found in the previous bullet is bigger than the version in the package.json, it uses it (and increments it by one) otherwise it uses the version in the package.json

**What it means**: Think of each list of 'major.minor' versions as a branch. The algorithm finds the branch of the version in the package json, and ignores all other branches. If the branch is empty, it will just use the version in package.json, otherwise it will use the Max of (the latest version in the branch, the package.json version) + 1.
