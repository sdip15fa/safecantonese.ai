# Safecantonese.ai app

## About

This app was made with the aim of bring safer AI Cantonese
transcription to the general public, backed by whisper speech-to-text
models developed by OpenAI and fine-tuned by me. Your audio files
are transcribed right in your device without ever leaving it.

## Download

**Warning**: The app on play store & github release apks after v1.7.0 work out of the box. If you wish to build yourself or use apks in github releases ï¼ˆprior to version 1.7.0), you must add the models into the assets/models directory into the apk and re-sign it by yourself. If you don't know what it means, use google play.

## Maintenance

Submit issues if you encounter any bugs or any feature requests.
I am going to take DSE soon so I won't be very active. Low-priority
issues may not be fixed. Please don't expect me (as I am really buzy)
to fix issues quickly. If a feature is deemed eazy to implement
(~10 mins of my time), then it's more possible I'll do it.

## Contributions

Pull requests are more than welcome. If you can fix a bug, or introduce a feature, feel free to do so. Please test carefully to make sure it doesn't break anything. Please also submit test videos for reference.
